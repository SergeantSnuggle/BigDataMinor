HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Excellent urban ryokan stay in Tokyo,"A unique and relaxing urban ryokan concept in Tokyo -- truly a one-of-a-kind. The top quality traditional Japanese furnishings and finishes were well-complemented by the high service standards provided by the HOSHINOYA Tokyo team who worked hard to accommodate guests' comfort, from delicious in-house prepared meals to customized activities such as kendo exercises, yukata-wearing, tea ceremony, Otemachi city walks, and sake-tasting. A wonderful ometenashi experience.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Top-notch guest service,"First off, I sought for an assistance to propose to my girlfriend at during our stay. The team at the HOSHINOYA Tokyo really have done what they are great at. It's the perfect place for the guest who wish to stay there for any special occasion. Start from a Front Office Manager, Ryoto-san who arranged most of the things prior to our arrival. Misaki-san who's in-charge for our arrival, and probably setting up of my surprise requests. The receptionist who kept communicating with me under my unstable plans. They all were superb and beyond my expectation. Pros: Staffs of course!, Real Onsen on the 19th floor (Dont miss!), lots of available activities during the stay. 24hrs relaxing lounge on each floor. Cozy room with tatami and a huge bathtub. Cons: The only thing you can find",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Not worth more than the price,"The room and lounge per floor are cozy and we loved loof-top and stylish Onsen. However, it seems the staff are relatively new and just telling what they memorized. Their service was good but not more than we expected for their price. Regret it is facing to a tall building so no nice view can be expected.",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Unique and Very special,"Excellent, beautiful hotel. If you want a truly Japanese experience you must visit and stay at least 2 nights. The hotel onsen is the most amazing place on the roof in open air it’s as though you are in a different world and the warm sleep inducing waters come from the spring in the earth underneath..... you must do room service it’s wonderfully Japanese and unique.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Might be worth staying once,"For many folks that are rushing through a Japan trip, the Hoshinoya Tokyo might be able to provide the only ryokan experience they'll ever have. For such purposes, it fits the bill. However, I would recommend that people try staying at a real ryokan in the countryside if they're looking for something truly authentic. This hotel is certainly stylish, and has a large number of English-speaking staff, which affords a first timer with a stress-free time in Tokyo. The interior decor is modern rather than traditional, which may or may not suit what someone is looking for in a ryokan-style property. Compared to some other luxury properties in Tokyo, the Hoshinoya falls short in several areas. First off, the entry-level rooms are on the small side. They're not tiny, but don't offer",30,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Stunningly beautiful ryokan style hotel,"What a wonderful find. A truly beautiful hotel with large, well-equipped rooms and a really warm welcome. Every member of staff we met was a delight - helpful, attentive and always happy to chat and make recommendations for things to do or places to go. Highly recommended",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A True Urban Ryokan Oasis,"Great hotel atmosphere, and accommodating and helpful staff. I enjoyed the unlimited ‘round-the-clock snacks and drinks in the lounge. I loved the indoor and outdoor onsen in the heart of Tokyo; a true urban oasis! It was a relaxing experience after a long day sightseeing.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,One of the most unique and finest hotel stays I have ever experienced. Top marks from the staff to the gorgeous rooms,"Gorgeous large rooms, a staff willing to go above and beyond and a stunning onsen bath on the rooftop that made Tokyo feel like a tranquil spa. Unreal experience. Unique breakfast room service, cultural activities nightly, and a Ryokan in the city decor that needs to be seen to be believed.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Zen in the middle of Tokyo,fell inlove with this grogeous traditional hotel in the middle of Tokyo / the onsen on the roof was an absolute dream . The perfect place to unwind after exploring the hustle and bustle of the city . Oh and the breakfast and comp snack are so naughty but so nice !,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Exquisite,"Amazing in every sense of the word! Quite literally the BEST accommodation I have stayed in. Attention to detail is unsurpassable, the welcome that every guest receives makes you feel like royalty. There should be a 6th star just for this place and its staff.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Without a doubt it was one of my favourite hotels in Tokyo.,Warm and great hospitality from the staffs. A great silent retreat to a lovely room atmosphere and decor with bluetooth speaker. Not forgetting the lovely Onsen too. Will definitely come back to stay.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Absolutely Fabulous!,"I would not stay anywhere else in Tokyo. Having the luxury ryokan experience made our 6 nights in Tokyo so much more memorable than if we had stayed in one of the cookie cutter luxury hotels (of which there are many). From the moment we checked in on our floor to the moment we checked out, everything was perfect. There are 6 rooms on each floor (we had two rooms-a king and a twin) and there is a central area on each floor where you can relax, have snacks and eat breakfast. Having access to tea, coffee, noodles, ice cream, drinks and snacks at anytime. The only thing missing was some fresh fruit The Onsen on the top floor was amazing. Also, the staff was so helpful. They arranged dining reservations and transportation itineraries and were so pleasant when serving breakfast.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,My Number 1 Hotel Recommendation,Hoshinoya hotel is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed at. I love all aspects of the services and facilities provided including the onsen (hot spring) and easy access to major metro lines. The staff is above and beyond and even helped us to book appointments. I will be coming back whenever I am in Japan. I highly recommend this hotel!,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Sublime hotel.,Its a stunning hotel with beautifully finished interiors paying great attention to detail. It has a small hotel feel.The staff could not be more helpful. The onsen is a great treat and rare for a Tokyo hotel. Very zen feel about it and I could not recommend it highly enough. Of course there are lots of cheaper hotels but you wont get this experience or quality so either book well in advance for a good deal or just save up! We will definitely be back.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Wonderful experience, special and different in that Japanese way.","It's in a business part of town but very close to several subway lines and a few minute walk to the Imperial Palace. Walkable to Marunouchi, Nihonbashi and Ginza. Great bathroom, spacious and modern, the usual separate WC. In room Japanese breakfast a delight, and nothing wrong with the Western breakfast either. Lighthearted free (eg. juggling) entertainment and sake tasting in the foyer every evening. Wonderful open air onsen, looking at the Tokyo sky, such a great experience in such an ""urban"" metropolis. Only inconvenience for me was low chairs in room and limited English TV (BBC and CNN) but really it's all I needed. A lounge on each floor to relax, mix with others or not (as you choose) with drinks, snacks and reading matter. Wonderful service, friendly, polite,",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,The Most Amazing Experience,Travelers would be amiss if they didn't try out the rooftop onsen. We stayed just one night and I went three times! The hotel itself is connected to Otemachi station and can be reached without leaving the station but note that the entrance is not very well marked (both the outside entrance and the entrance connected to the station). The staff were all wonderful and courteous. We actually had a very terrible snafu and checked in one day late and they could not honor our reservation even though we already paid. We had to pay AGAIN and they luckily had one room available. We never got the refund from the reservation we didn't use. This is not the fault of the hotel staff but I do wish they were more understanding as they were paid but no services were actually rendered. I'm,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing accommodation and experience,"oshinoya Tokyo exceeded our expectations. A very memorable and relaxing experience. Friendly and helpful staff, immaculate rooms and service. Plenty of additional complimentary activities. Shared lounge room with drinks and snacks as well as relaxing area was amazing. The best open air onsen and facilities were the best we have experienced. We can’t wait to stay here again.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,This hotel is a must stay!,"After 10 days of ski trip to Hokkaido we were ready for some luxury and we got it , right in the heart of Tokyo , 5 mins walk to Tokyo station and all its ammenities is the Hoshinoya, met at drop off 2 levels down were wisked to our roonm and then checked in! There is a communal living room per floor stocked with hi quality , tea , drinks beer , snacks and evry conveiable guet requirement. The room was to my eye traditional Japenese, with matting , low comfortable beds , screens and finished to a high standard. The building itself is magnificent , check out web pics. Onsen , hot bath at 17th floor level has to be tried to be believed! Food best we had in a fortnight . Just there if you can.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Such an amazing hotel,"A group of us from the uk had been working in osaka and niseko before heading to Tokyo to return to the UK. We opted to stay in the hoshinoya hotel. En route from the airport we were involved in a car crash, the hotel were amazing, they called the authorities and helped us sort insurance details and dealt with the police. They even gave us ice packs for whip lash when we arrived back after dinner. We did have a slight miscommunication over the number of people in our room. This was quickly resolved the following morning, the manager Ryota was amazing in how he helped resolve the issue. He even arranged for a discount on one of the most amazing suites so that all three of us could stay together.... the whole situation was very well handled. The service generally is next level.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Hotel that’s more concerned about their plastic card than guest experience?,"Booked 4 rooms for 2 nights at this hotel (second time staying here). One of us misplaced the room key. Was charged ¥10,000 for that. Plastic card in a wooden box. Most unfortunate. Service is otherwise good. It is one thing to encourage return of key, but it is another to charge ¥10,000 for misplacing a key. Not as if we were informed in advance either. You have been warned.",10,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Calm and Tranquility,"Stayed in a triple room for two nights before heading to Niseko skiing The most tranquil and calm hotel I have stayed in anywhere in the world Cannot recommend highly enough - rooms, shared areas and check in all absolutely perfect",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Modern Ryokan Hotel with Onsen in Tokyo,"We stayed for a few days in Hoshinoya Tokyo in Dec 2018 and it was a unique experience. The hotel is a blend of traditional ryokan and modern architecture which is very interesting. The entrance is stunning with stacked wicker baskets and they take your shoes to store them. We stayed at a corner room and it was quite spacious. I love the onsen and both times we were there it was empty. They also provide light breakfast, snacks and coffee for us in the common room.",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,When I can come again?,"This hotel is amazing and a must if you're visiting Tokyo. Beautiful interiors, comfortable and clean. Impeccable, attentive, top of the class customer service from start to finish. Loved their emphasis on attention to detail. Great entertainment/activities fitting for the hotel and their guests. Fantastic Onsen on site. Good location for visiting every corner of Tokyo using the metro. So relaxing and we had great sleeps every night. A huge THANK YOU to all the staff for looking after us!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,When can I come back?,"As soon as I arrived I was thinking of ways to return. If your idea of heaven is the personalized service you receive at a traditional ryokan yet you love the modern luxury of a boutique full service hotel and if you are an modern architecture lover stop no further than the Hoshinoya Tokyo. It is literally heaven. You are whisked up to the floor you are staying on, there is a lounge with snacks and tea, all beautiful offerings. The room has the beds already set up, not the traditional set up of the futon in the evening, but they are luxurious and so very comfortable. The little seating area is sweet. The bathroom with the Japanese bath and separate toilet are heaven. The bathhouse is on the top floor and if you're jet lagged like I was, coming from California and you're",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Zen Hotel in Heart of Tokyo,"Beautiful Ryokan in the heart of Tokyo Japan. So quiet its almost insulated... you can experience this place and not really know whats going on outside. Lovely rooms. Onsen on the roof. Nice public spaces. Restaurant was in the lower level, first rate food and a beautiful space Overall this was an excellent experience but I would give it a 4-1/2 stars due to a few missteps by the staff: -During tasting menu/wine paired dinner, asked for a wine refill. waitress says there is an additional charge. I tell her there shouldn't be. Not a big deal. But annoying, At these prices to tell any guest that the 2 oz pour is all they are getting for 2 courses is stupid. A restaurant at this level should know better. -took multiple tries for bell-person to order an airport taxi. She was",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Contemporary hotel,"I love this boutique hotel right in the midst of town. It offers a traditional setting of an Inn with such a class of Japanese culture service. The peace and quiet surroundings when you walked in there , in the midst of hustle and bustling city. Staff was attentive and charming. They should provide a proper cigar smoking room to align with its image of top class hospitality. I went to Amman hotel a few blocks to enjoy that smoke. Highly recommended for discerning visitors.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Excellent stay for three nights.,"Serene, relaxing, superb service. Modern re-invention of the Ryokan experience. Stay here if you get a chance. We have been to Japan many times, and experienced many hotels and ryokans. This clearly ranks amongst the top. We stayed with our 2.5 years old daughter, and were a bit concerned that this place might be too luxurious, too fragile, too noise sensitive for our lively, active, strong-willed little one, but not too worry. The noise insulation between rooms is excellent, all the staff were not just friendly towards our daughter but seemed truly delighted to interact with her. As adults, we were relaxed the moment we entered the hotel and were guided to our room. I went to the Onsen twice every day and came back even more relaxed each time. The many typical Japanese",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Hands down the best hotel EVER,"This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at. From the attentive staff to the beautiful detail in every room, to the architecture and design, and the amazing culture fostered within the ryokan, we were whisked away in a parallel universe of tranquility beauty and relaxation. The onsen hot water spring on the rooftop is the cherry on the top, and one of the main features of this exquisite hotel. Generous, clean, designed to please every sense. What’s not to love. We didn’t want to leave! Will definitely be coming back, and visiting every other Hoshinoya if given the chance!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,An experience not to be missed!,"This was our first visit to Hoshinoya! We arrived by chauffeur to an underground car park entrance and were quickly ushered into an entrance and taken up to the actual hotel entrance. Make no mistake this hotel is in a city building, but that’s where city building ends! Everything inside the building screams ryokan! From the moment we entered we felt like we had gone back to another era. We stayed in a corner suite with futon beds, screen doors and traditional food. The onsen is divine and there are two for male and female, but you must unrobe to use. Apparently the onsen is supplied from a spring underground and pumped up to the top of the building. We had jetlag and awoke in the middle of the night and found the communal lounge on our floor especially relaxing and",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,FABULOUS!!,"The staff, room, amenities were incredible. The tranquil atmosphere, the beautiful surroundings were over the top. Rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. Our family of teenagers loved this hotel - complimentary snacks, impeccable service! Next to Otemachi subway station (1 short stop from Tokyo station or a 10 minute walk)",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A little gem in the heart of Tokyo ...,Great location but very quiet; close to the Metro station. Onsen after a busy day of sight-seeing/shopping is amazing. Lounge with unlimited supply of tea/coffee/drinks/snacks makes you feel like you are home. In-room dining is great. Staffs are friendly and attentive. You can literally stay in the hotel for a day to relax.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,The onsen is amazing!!,"The services and facilities of this hotel are extraordinary! Very polite and attentive service, and the staff were always helpful with recommending and booking restaurants for us, especially during New Years where most places are closed and it is hard to get a booking. The onsen is like no other I have experienced in Tokyo, with an amazing outdoor layout in the middle of the city which still maintains privacy, and was relaxing to use. Traditional rules apply, so no tattoos allowed, however the hotel kindly provided me with skin stickers to cover up my tattoos so I can use the onsen. I don't usually eat large breakfasts even when I'm at home, so the complimentary breakfast provided by the hotel was perfect for me! It consisted simply of soup and fresh made riceballs containing",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Luxury At It’s Finest,"Pure luxury. My room was huge with a spa like bathroom. The hotel is centrally located on Tokyo and walking distance to many fine restaurants and sight seeing and upscale shopping. The service at the hotel was exceptional and no detail was omitted from pleasing the customer. Dinner in the private dining room was done with elegance, flavors that would challenge any tastebuds and very very entertaining. I hated to leave this beautiful and very welcoming hotel. A definite place to stay to experience a modern luxury Riokan",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Alternative experience to Tokyo hotels,"Of course the design and concept is amazing! Its so perfect, just a perfect japanese style hotel. I think if I could, i would give it 4,5. Because there are some minor this that are a bit unusual. But only because they are unusual in standard hotel types. When you just enter the hotel, you have to take off your shoes (japanese style). Since we came with our baby and needed the stroller. They actually wiped the wheels of our stroller every time we re entered. Btw, there are absolutely no non resident guests allowed in the hotel! There is no real lobby, but there is a sort of living room on every floor, for the 4 rooms on that floor. Where its quite cosy. And all you can drink and eat snaks. Sort of co living:)) of course the onsen is breath talking! Its just one of a kind! So in",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Excellent but,"There were a few things that felt strange. Though I am a Tokyo native, perhaps because I now live in California, I thought the amount of plastics visible in this hotel was ridiculous. Everything, crackers, candies, noodles, socks, toothbrush, hair brush, was wrapped in plastics. I am sure people commented on beautiful natural things about this hotel, like paper screen or wooden doors, so I just wanted to point out to the hotel management or owner that they should be mindful not to leave plastic covered food and amenities everywhere as they do make some of us feel uncomfortable. That’s not a luxurious experience but rather troubling, as other high end natural materials like hinoki or old bamboo repurposed chopsticks start looking not authentic and genuine due to that",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Serene, gracious — a gorgeous hushed retreat in the midst of Tokyo","What a treat — a peaceful little oasis in the middle of a mad city! The open air onsen (hot bath) on the top floor is a revelation, the rooms are subtle and cozy, and the in-room breakfast service flawless. Despite the feeling of being dreamily suspended in time, you are actually right on top of a metro line and so very conveniently connected to wherever your adventures take you in Tokyo. Would certainly stay again.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Memorable stay,"The staff at the Hoshinoya are all in constant communication. So they are able to anticipate your every need and action. They are like one unified pulse. We arrived early in the morning, our room was not yet ready. But they offered us a room to refresh and made us rice balls, miso soup and the most delicious filter coffee for breakfast. Rooms: Very spacious for Tokyo standard. Traditional style/ decor, all the amenities. They provide kimonos which can be used throughout the hotel and you are encouraged to wear them outside the hotel if you are exploring the imperial palace. Lounge: Each floor has a lounge to be used by the guests staying on that floor. This is where breakfast is served. It is stocked with snacks which change throughout the day and a fridge with water, soft",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Seriously lovely,"You are absolutely pampered and well looked after here. Beautiful property and rooms, great amenities, excellent hot baths. The included breakfast, snacks, water, beer mean you aren't being nickel and dimed like in some hotels. It's an oasis of comfort in a very busy city. Top marks.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Memorable Experience-HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"This Hotel is the perfect combination of location, facilities, and warm and friendly staff. The bonus onsite ONSEN and SPA is the perfect way to relax after a long day of sightseeing or business. Access to the METRO was super convenient and made it especially easy to get around town or for travel to other parts of Japan. We’ll be back to visit Japan soon and HOSHINOYA TOKYO will be part of our plans. I unequivocally recommend this wonderful facility. Thank you to the entire staff.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Worth,"U paid what you get, do not hestitate with the price. Especially the room service, and the location too pretty convenient in tokyo. And the Onsen is perfect! Unfortunately i didnt try the dinner service",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Contemporary style and traditional hospitality,"A contemporary interpretation of the traditional Japanese ryokan with sublime comfort and amazing service. Leave your shoes by the door and pad about in comfort on the tatami mats through this beautiful hotel. Bedrooms are huge likewise beds, a glass enclosure for the deep bath and shower and separate toilet room with the ubiquitous technical Japanese toilet. If you opt for a breakfast inclusive deal this is served in your room whether Western or Japanese style in an amazing compendium of bento boxes. BTW the coffee is excellent. Otherwise “free” eats and drinks are available at all times in the large lounge area on each floor. Best of all is the onsen (hot bath fed from a spring under the hotel) segregated baths as you go in naked having washed off first in a very smart shower",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Excellent stay,Very comfortable one week stay. Service is exceptional. The staff are always there to help but not in your face. They all speak english very well too. Helped me with booking shinkansen train and shipping internationally. Rooms are very modern but felt true to japanese design. Train station with several lines is accessible from the hotel so you can pretty much reach everywhere in Tokyo without a hassle. Will definitely stay again when I return to Tokyo.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Extraordinary Japanese cultural experience,Beautiful design and excellent services. We stayed in Hoshinoya in Kyoto which is the reason bought us to HOSHINOYA Tokyo. It is very challenging for hotel staff to manage 80+ pairs of shoes at the entrance but management did well. Will definitely try other Hoshinoya properties in other cities.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Elegant zen den in the midst of the world's most populated city,"It's an amazing zen experience in the midst of the worlds most populated and bustling city. The room, bath, floor lounge, and hot bath were all wonderful and relaxed. The evening free Sake tasting was great. We loved it all.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Gorgeous Hotel,"Truly the best hotel I've ever stayed at - pricey but well worth it! Not a single detail is spared. Combines the best of traditional Japanese ryokan life with the comfort of modern luxury. Service was top notch, environs were super clean and comfortable, and every detail was so thoughtfully presented. The onsen on the roof is a real hot spring. Location is in the financial district but very close to a metro station which is invaluable for getting around Tokyo.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Not comparable to the Hoshinoya in Kyoto,We have stayed at Hoshinoya in Kyoto (Arashiyama) twice before and absolute loved it. So was quite disappointed with our stay here in Tokyo. It is catered more for family; there were little children even in the Onsen. And loud groups. Not the tranquil experience we were expecting despite the beautiful rooms and interior design. We were here 2 nights and the famed restaurant was fully booked both nights. So the first night we ordered room service which was pretty dreary. The staff service was inconsistent. Most were excellent but we had some unhelpful replies which was astonishing for a place of this calibre.,40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Culture + Luxury,"My husband and I stayed at Hoshinoya Tokyo on the first night of our honeymoon. The service and cultural experience was outstanding from the moment we arrived. My husband forgot a bag on the bus we took from the airport and within a few hours the hotel had called the bus company, tracked down our missing bag and arranged for us to pick it up at a nearby train station that evening. Traditional touches were woven throughout the hotel experience. The guest room was spacious and well-designed. The tea lounge with complimentary snacks and drinks was a treat. The greatest feature of the hotel was the onsen. A gorgeous and authentic experience. We will definitely return to Hoshinoya!",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Fantastic start to our Japan visit,"I can wholeheartedly recommend Hoshinoya Tokyo. It is an oasis to which to return after a busy day sightseeing. The staff were wonderful, the onsen beautiful and the evening meal to die for. All other meals we have had here pale by comparison ( and we have water at some of the highest rated restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto). The only negative is the rather average breakfast. But then again we have not yet found a great breakfast in Japan).",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,True Ryokan in the heart of Tokyo,"Very special hotel in Tokyo. Each six rooms has a private lounge. Tatami rooms, miso soup at breakfast and sake at happy hour. Service was excellent and the hotel restaurant, open only to hotel guests is not to be missed. Rooftop onset a special delight! On my drawback is on weekends, the immediate area is dead. Lively areas are close by though Would stay again in a heartbeat",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A cocoon in Tokyo,From the moment one steps through the impressive cypress entrance door one feels like in an other world. Taking off the shoes and walking on the tatami mats gives a wonderful feeling like being at home (where we do not use outdoors shoes either). We were escorted to the 16th floor (thank you for meeting my request!) where we were checked in sitting in the spacious floor lounge. We stayed in the hotel for 20 hours and never saw any one else on our floor (only 6 rooms). After a relaxing onsen bath on the 17th floor - what a feeling sitting in an outside onsen bath so high up in the middle of Tokyo) we choose to wear the lovely kimono which is provided in the room to have a try on the different sake in the main lobby (2nd floor). Our dinner afterwards was fabulous. The 'sleep well',50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Memorable Unforgettable Stay in Tokyo/Feel traditional in downtown,"This hotel is where you can experience the REAL JAPAN. Place: Really great place. Close station is Otemachi Station (One stop from Tokyo station), about 10min walk from Tokyo Station. You can feel classic Tokyo in the area of business and imperial palace. Stay: THE BEST. I have stayed so many hotels but this one was the best. They have natural hot spring in the top floor with open air in this Tokyo middle area where you can actually feel the open air. At the hot spring area, they offer milk/coffee milk and that made the night after beautiful hot spring BEST. Each floor, they have few rooms which is really quiet and have one lounge where you can get snacks/drinks/light food anytime. Food in the lounge was really great which is made in Japan, you can also buy it in the 2nd",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing Hotel with fabulous Japanese Rooms and Spa.Highly recommended.,"If in Tokyo if you can possibly get a room then you should. The rooftop Spa is amazing, the rooms are unique complete with kimonos and pyjamas and the service is first class, the best Hotel in Tokyo by far.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Perfect start to a honeymoon,We were treated like kings and queens by their exceptional staff. The dinner was booked our during our stay but they helped us find an alternative which was excellent. We spent the first night of our honeymoon there and I would highly recommend for a night or two depending on your budget.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Delightful experience,"We stayed one night and were very impressed. Very organized and great personal recognition. Breakfast in our room, 1 western and 1 Japanese was impressive. Service staff was a pleasure. Would definitely stay here again.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Luxurious contemporary Ryokan in busy Tokyo,"The moment you step into this modern Ryokan, you know that you are in for a treat. You leave your shoes at the door and are escorted to your Japanese style room. The room offers al the modern amenities you expect from this kind of hotel, but with respect to the Japanese ryokan style. We had to stay in our room one day due to the Typhoon Hagibis, but enjoyed the hotel. On the top floor there is a beautiful onsen with outdoor pool. It was exceptional to sit in this outdoor onsen, with a Typhoon raging around you. The restaurant is top notch, with very creative approach to Japanese cuisine. The Hotel is within walking distance of several must see districts and there is a subway station in the basement .",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Fabulous hotel,A truly special and memorable hotel experience - beautiful finish to rooms and communal lounge areas. Very peaceful with excellent beds. Superb service. Although an excellent dining experience with a good tasting menu - our dinner in the restaurant did not quite meet expectations.,40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A peaceful place in the middle of the city,"Everything about this place is done to a special standard. From the entrances and the soothing scent as you enter the ground floor to the peaceful gentle music played on each floor, the hotel makes you feel at ease. We enjoyed removing our shoes and walking around in bare feet, it made the whole place feel relaxing rather than just the room. Our corner room was really spacious. I'm inclined to say simple but in a truly luxurious way. What really made the stay special was the evening dinner. It wasn't just the wonderful food, the overall experience was incredible right from the moment the lift doors opened. I'm not going to write any spoilers about it, just do it! This was our first experience of the Hoshinoya group but if this is the benchmark then it certainly won't be our",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Cannot fault this hotel,"From the moment we arrived, this hotel felt like a calming oasis in the center of Tokyo. The hotel was beautiful, relaxing and the staff were friendly and attentive. The location is in the business district close enough to get to Ginza for shopping and some great restaurants yet far enough away to not be in the crowds. The onsen is a must try and very relaxing. We were there with our 3 year old who loved the common area and I made a comment that he thought it was his living room, and that is really the feel there, the place really felt like a home away from home.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Perfection in Tokyo,"We had the pleasure of spending our first two nights in japan at hoshinoya. From first greeting to farewell we were pampered and surrounded by sensory delights. Staff and their uniforms, room and lounge design as well as public areas all contributed to perfection. Beppu bath salts were a special treat for in room tub. 16th floor public bath amazing as you could hear din of street noises below. We did not eat meals at ryokan and expect the same high standards. I feel very fortunate to have experienced Hoshinoya .",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Restful and traditional,"This lovely traditional ryokan was a restful haven from the Tokyo crowds; we were here for the rugby World Cup, and we were grateful for the peace & quiet. A short walk from Tokyo station this hotel is well situated for shops & businesses, and it’s easy to reach tourist sights by train & underground. The staff are delightful, helpful and speak good English. The rooms are well appointed and quiet, & each floor has a communal sitting room where extra refreshments are available. There is an Onsen on the top floor, a spa, and a restaurant in the basement. Highly recommend.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A tranquil and traditional stop,"This is a beautiful and traditional hotel, perhaps not for those who want the most convenience and western norm, but definitely for those who want to be in Japan ...as you a; take your shoes off at the door, b: arrive early for check in ‘come back at your check in time’, c; there is no bar, d; the hot springs it is traditional to bathe naked,e; rice and rice with a bit of fish for a included breakfast...... This hotel is lovely, pretty special, however, some will want something more familiar and less local.

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Perfect traditional Japanese service in a contemporary setting.,"We stayed in one of the larger ""corner"" rooms, on the 11th floor. We would have chosen a standard room, but none were available on short notice. Our room was gorgeous and enormous, the bathroom sumptuous with a great separate shower and giant bathtub. Walk-through closet had plenty of room for lots of hanging clothes and also suitcases. Futon bed was wonderfully comfy... middle-aged Westerners like us will groan a bit getting up from floor level in the middle of the night, but it's good for your quad muscles! The tatami-matted floors are so easy on the feet and so clean and aesthetically pleasing; shedding your shoes on entrance to the hotel is a civilized touch in our opinion. Metro is barely steps away at the Otemachi station, and I understand the Tokyo station is only a",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Wonderful Japanese Hospitality,"4 friends stayed here for the rugby World Cup. We did not know what to expect but from the moment we stepped inside the doors we were simply blown away. Hoshinoya exudes an aura of calm and tranquility and the staff were always very helpful. The rooms were spacious and amazingly decorated. The highlight was the communal room per floor. We spent a lot of time there and enjoyed amazing coffee made for us in the mornings. The Onsen is a must try - but be prepared to take al your clothes off to enter. I can’t wait to come back, but this time with my family. A great experience.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Practically Perfect in Every Way,"My room was lovely. Although I only had a view of offices, the screens over the windows meant I never even thought about it. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom had a huge and deep bathtub (with the water faucet from the side so it could really be a 2-person tub) as well as a separate shower. The toilet was in its own room complete with toilet slippers. The tv was in the wall, there was a great bluetooth speaker so you could listen to your own tunes. There was an electric kettle as well as a tiny refrigerator in my room. The lounge was stocked with several books in Japanese, but the few I flipped through had very nice photos. There were also snacks which changed throughout the day and complementary drinks of a couple different canned drinks, and tea and coffee. The included",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Fabulous Hotel,"A wonderful experience to stay in this unique hotel which offers a Japanese experience. from the entry lobby where you are greeted as if arriving home to the moment you leave this is a special place. It does not offer all the usual western trappings of bar, choice of restaurant, but it does have an amazing Onsen on the top floor (and a spa i think - but we did not use). Rooms beautifully designed with all the add ons you would want, and each floor has a central sitting area for (japanese) breakfast or just tea etc. it is located in the business area which does feel a bit strange if you are a tourist! to eat out (as the only eat in option is the super deluxe dinner in the basement, with all the courses - and price to match) you have to go the vast underground maze of shopping and",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A fabulous hotel!,"Hoshinoya Tokyo is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Situated in the financial district it is close to Tokyo Railway station and the Emperor’s Palace. The only negative with the location is that there are none of those delightful little Tokyo side and back street bars and restaurants close. However a very small price to pay! The hotel is a boutique hotel and CBD Ryokan. The Ryokan theme is immediately obvious as you arrive when you leave your shoes at the front door of the hotel. The service is quite, quite exceptional but of course the Japanese excel in service and the refreshing part of it is that is their culture rather than attempting to garner a larger tip. The rooms are excellent and exude style. Little things like the shower liquid soap (I normally hate",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,An Oasis in Tokyo,Unfortunately just one night at this wonderfully elegant and quiet hotel in the heart of Tokyo. Impeccable service and amenities as well as walking distance from Tokyo station and access to several metro stations. Amazing.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Best Hotel in Tokyo - Luxury Meets Tradition,"I've been to Tokyo several times in the past, but always either for short stops in transit to other locations or for work related trips. For my most recent trip to celebrate my birthday, Japan was the focal point. Since Tokyo was the starting point for my 2 week stay in the country, I wanted my kickoff hotel to be extra special. Tokyo has no shortage of luxury hotels, but the experience at Hoshinoya convinced me this unique property is easily among the top, if not the top, hotel in Tokyo. Upon entering the large wooden doors on the ground floor, one or two attendants will greet you by name and take your shows. As other reviews mention, the entire hotel is built like an old tatami mat ryokan, so all staff and guests walk around in socks. It's both charming and cozy, and really",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Unique experience,"Fantastic ryokan / hotel in the middle of the financial district in Tokyo, quite close to the central station; impeccable service, large rooms, an own onsen.... what do you need more? And you have an additional resting space (shared with 4 other rooms/guests) in addition to your room, with sweets, tea, beer etc. to relax & plan the next steps",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Quiet Unique Hotel Experience,We were a family of four arriving in early September. The whole experience here is unique for a city hotel. Everything from taking your shoes off at the entry to the few rooms on each floor made this a nice quiet environment. I have to say that I think we saw other people only once on our floor during our three nights stay. Everyone we dealt with were friendly and helpful. Always enjoyed our interactions with the staff. The rooms were spacious and modern.....nice bathrooms and comfortable beds. Breakfasts were nicely presented and very good. Only things I would point out is that they didn’t have a lounge for a cocktail and no gym. Not major but something that we like to see. We would definitely stay here again.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Luxury ryokan hidden in the heart of Tokyo,"We have visited Tokyo multiple times and this has to be our most memorable stay! It is luxury ryokan combined with that feeling of home away from home, starting right from the minute you stepped into the hotel and keep away your shoes to the private lounge area (ochanama) on each floor where we enjoy a variety japanese snacks and beverages. While the location is in the heart of the business district, it can be confusing to navigate or find the way to the hotel from the subway. The hotel is also rather new and many cab drivers got lost while finding it. It also doesn’t help that the drive-in entrance is in the basement of an office building, so there were alot of confusion lost in translation. Nonetheless, we had a wonderful stay and look forward to return. Hopefully by then,",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Wonderful modern ryokan in the heart of Tokyo,"Wonderful experience in great central location. Superb, beyond helpful staff, great combination of Japanese tradition and modern luxury. Delightful in room breakfast service. Do enjoy the the hot spring bath on the 17th floor with sky view.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Unique japanese experience,"Hoshinoya Tokyo is a modern ryokan located in the business district, offering a luxurious traditional japanese experience. We booked a triple room for our family (Kiku) and were very happy with our comfortable stay. The hotel is very unique, you can not wear shoes inside, and in my opinion is mostly suitable for adults. It is a very quiet hotel, very japanese. The onsen is fantastic, and is quite amazing to be able to bathe in a open-air onsen in the middle of Tokyo. For those looking for an original japanese experience, stay here, at least for a couple of days. It is worth every cent.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Most luxe hotel with amazing service,"Cannot fault anything about this hotel. It was beyond luxe, and the staff were all so nice. Each level (6 rooms per level) has a common tea room with access to snacks for guests all day. Breakfast consists of rice rolls, soup and pour over coffee made on the spot by your host. The rooms are exceptionally beautiful and so comfortable. The onsen is a beautifully unique experience with an atrium so that you are sitting under the night sky. Bespoke in-room check-in experience with gifts for guests. 10 min walk to nearest train lines. Allow plenty of time for check-out as staff are meticulous and it is busy at this time.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Astonishing-beyond our expectations.,"5 nights, two adults. Perfect blend of Japanese style and hospitality and modern luxury. We were blown away. Convenient to Tokyo Station. Perfect oasis in the middle of the city. Discounts available when booked in advance.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,The most wonderful hotel.,"The staff cared for our every need, the bedrooms were beautifully appointed and laid out. The facilities were great, especially the onsen. We also really enjoyed the communal area on our floor where we could have snacks and relax. Simply superb!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Vacation in Japan,"I never leave a review, although Hoshinoya deserves to be shared to everyone. It is beyond fantastic! The service is unmatched, rooms are clean and create a calm and relaxing atmosphere. We loved the tea room designated to our on floor, it really removed any feeling that anyone else was even staying at the ryokan. Uki’s balancing acts at the sake lounge were very funny and entertaining. I honestly felt tears welling up in my eyes as we pulled away, not because I was sad we were leaving, but because the service and kindness was unparalleled from the second we arrived until we pulled away from the door. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a true ryokan experience in the heart of Tokyo.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing Japanese experience,"From the minute you set foot inside this wonderful hotel you are transported into another world. No shoes and a beautiful onsen. My first onsen experience and not my last. A wonderful dark magical thermal bath that opens up to the sky, I could have stayed for hours! Great food served in my room and a mirror with a tv inside. Super, just go and experience!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Highly recommended this hotel for your comfort and enjoyable holiday,"Awesome on-sen experience, as well as lounge offering free drinks (soft drink, coffee and tea, water) and snacks, open 24hours. Staffs are helpful as always. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Definitely stay here again when I come back to Tokyo",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Hidden Treasure in the City,"Love how discreet this place is. Top notch service and spacious rooms. The elegant and minimalist design of the whole ryokan is a dream! Enjoyed the Ochanoma Lounge outside our room, most of the time we had the place to ourselves and felt like our own personal space. Well stocked reading materials, drinks and snacks we can help ourselves to at any time. Soaking in the outdoor onsen with pretty lanterns lit up at night was one of my most memorable moments Easy access to transport and plenty of restaurants nearby. Perfect place in Tokyo for me!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Dream,Very good hotel and service. Our time out was so relaxing. The food and drinks were so good. It was a very good trip. The hotel was very central in Tokyo City. Many shops and restaurants are near to the hotel. Many choices available.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Oasis in the heart of Tokyo,"Second time staying here and definitely the hotel to go to in Tokyo! Spacious and comfy room with a common area on each floor. Onsen on top beats everything :) Located right at city center which is highly accessible and have wide range of choices on shops and restaurants. Lastly, staff here were amazing and thoughtful which makes your stay even more pleasant. Will be back soon!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Big brother is everywhere,"The hotel is very unique and beautiful. Located perfectly.The neighborhood is an impressive business area, very new and modern. Our room was nice, named Yuri, a corner deluxe room. It seemed bigger on the web probably because we thought that being located at the corner would let us feel that the room was bigger because of two sides view. Unfortunately, one wall that was supposed to create the corner was blocked (no windows), so practically we had only one side “open” and thus there was no difference between that room and the lower category in that sense. This is why there is no “need” to book that category if you look for a real corner. The onsen itself is terrific.Much more terrific and really tranquil when less people around. But anyway, I really enjoyed it. Why the",30,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Hoshinoya Tokyo - an exceptional establishment with true “heart”(thoughtfulness) & “soul”(culture),"Hoshinoya Tokyo is a place where we truly feel like “guests” and not customers, and our time spent there was not just a stay but a “treasured experience”. Think “cultural institution” (& not merely a hotel), “sophistication” (instead of just quality), “tastefulness”(versus plain luxury), and “genuine hospitality” rather than service. The dinner my wife and I had was an exceptional gastronomical journey in which we were surprised by the stunning presentations, creativity, amazing tastes and textures of every course. We enjoyed the rooftop onsen also but probably should have had the spa treatment too for an even more complete/immersive experience. Only comment: perhaps can be more uncompromising about the minimalist aesthetics and be more subtle in labelling of shampoo, body",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Best Hotel in Tokyo,This Hotel is beyond your highest expectations! Front he moment you arrive to the moment you leave the staff can not do enough for you. The Hotel room is amazing and the common room on each floor is a great space to hang out.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Disappointing,"I’ve never written a bad review before but this hotel really set a record. The service at this hotel is beyond disappointing. We did not expect this kind of service especially in Japan. We booked a double room and left a message that we would have three people staying, and even sent them an email asking if a bed can be added to no reply. I want to know what kind of 5 star rated hotel doesnt respond to their customers? All other Japanese hotels we have previously stayed at allowed the addition of a bed for 3 in a double room for an extra fee, but this hotel claims it to be Japanese law that a bed can't be added, which according to my Japanese friend, isn't true. They didn’t specify this on any hotel booking platform they are registered on, and it is only natural for us as",10,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,extraordinary experience,"in the world of hotels, hoshinoya is something i never had experienced, a perfect mix of japanese tradition with contemporary comfort. Sophistication and elegance. Thje Onsen will remain an extraodinary discover when, hit by jetlag, I discovered it, alone, at 3 in the morning.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing Boutique Hotel - beyond compare,"We stayed for 4 nights at the Hoshinoya Tokyo. We booked early (120 days ""advance"" booking) and got a very decent price for a corner room. When you enter the hotel you feel immediately calm because it is so quiet and serene - since there are not so many rooms (only 6 for each floor) it does not feel like a typical hotel despite it's size but rather truly like a luxury guest house. The hotel is simply fabulous, the service is impeccable and the room is beautifully furnished - very spacious (knowing that Tokyo is rather known for small and crowded spaces) and fully equipped with everything that makes you feel at home. The bathroom is huge - separate shower and bathtub and the Japanese luxury toilet is both fun and very practical :-) The staff was super helpful and with direct",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A great base in Tokyo,"We picked HOSHINOYA Tokyo for part of our honeymoon trip and it was probably the best hotel we’ve ever stayed in. They definitely wowed us constantly and we loved all the authentic features and touches. The staff were all so friendly, welcoming and enthusiastic. They constantly went out of their way to anticipate requests and exceed our expectations. The catering throughout was excellent, and the self service minibar, snack and hot drinks area on each floor is really handy. We went for a tea ceremony in the lobby area and this great fun; a really nice balance between authentic experience and cultural insight. We also particularly loved the onsen, which was a wonderful place to relax after a busy day exploring. As far as anything in Tokyo can be “well located,” HOSHINOYA is",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,The best,"Every single thing about this hotel is amazing. I was scared off by the price (just expensive for me) but if you stay a few nights, you can get a reduced rate. I'm so glad that it was every bit worth the price.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Best hotel, hands down",We loved the Hoshinoya! The accommodations were impeccable and the service was second to none. The Onsen was our nightly respite after walking around Tokyo all day. The restaurant food and food presentation were superior.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,very authentic hotel,"everything about this hotel was so different and exciting. at first the whole not having shoes was strange but then once we. embraced it, was quit freeing. I loved the traditional tea ceremony. the Onsen Japanese hot spring was so amazing the whole experience was very authentic. they really pay attention to detail. what was unexpectedly fabulous was the shared living room. we loved it. the breakfast could of had more choses.... the fish was a bit much for us westerners, however I still really enjoyed it.",50,1

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Relaxing hotel with Rooftop hot springs,"Really enjoyed our stay here! There are only 6 rooms on each floor, and a Tea Lounge to share with other guests on the same floor. In the tea lounge, there are complimentary beverages and snacks. Every morning they provide free rice balls and miso soup, and you can have them either in the lounge or your own room. My favorite part is the rooftop hot spring. After a long day of walking in the city, a relaxation in the soothing hot spring is much needed. Also, every afternoon 5-7pm, there is a free sake tasting on the 2nd floor. We had a good time sampling 4 different kinds of Japanese sake and wine.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Unique experience,"Booked two rooms for our week long family stay in Tokyo. Initially I was looking for reasonable proximity to Tokyo Station and an alternative to western style hotels. The Hoshinoya Tokyo completely surprised us. My sons (16 and 18) rarely voice any approval to their parents choices, but on this occasion we were met with approving smiles. The lounge area on each floor was an excellent way of spending time away from the madness to Tokyo and the top floor Onsen is both stylish and a great way to relax at the end of a day. Finally the staff were faultless. No request was ignored. All I can say is that we loved it.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Best hotel we've stayed ever!,"Everything about this hotel was so well executed from the unique counter-less check-in process to the free 24/7 snacks on each floor to the unique outdoor hot spring on the top floor.

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A unique hotel with excellent service,"My family and I stayed at Hoshinoya, Tokyo during our first trip to Japan. This hotel is really unique : it has its own onsen (each for ladies and gents) on 17th floor; on each floor has its own tea lounge that serves Japanese treats around the clock; every afternoon on the reception floor (2nd fl) we could try 4 different kinds of sake whilst watching short performances or just having conversations with the family, fun! The service was superb and the staff was friendly and genuinely helpful. The design of the room was ryokan-like. The room and bathroom were spacious, the bed was comfortable. The hotel itself is located in the financial district area, so it’s facing directly the opposite office building (maybe that’s just one of its downside). If you’re looking to stay in",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing design hotel. Onsen was the highlight,We loved this hotel for the luxury Japanese ryokan experience. This was our first stay in Japan and it made an amazing first impression. The staff fussed over us and allowed us to take a late rice ball breakfast despite our jet lag. The rooms and open space were beautifully designed and the particular highlight was the onsen. I loved the skylight up to the sky above and it was a peaceful retreat from city life. The outside was also particularly distictictive with an ornate leaf design. This was a very special place; I can highly recommend.,50,1

Complimentary breakfast is excellent. In room dining is exquisite. HOSHINOYA dinner in their restaurant is superb.The quality of snacks and drinks in the tea room are all of excellent quality. I have not been writing any reviews for the past 6 years but need to start again. HOSHINOYA deserves every bit of promotion that I can offer. My favorite Tokyo hotel. I have stayed in the Peninsula Tokyo, Ritz Carlton, Park Hyatt and many others but HOSHINOYA is by far #1!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,THE BEST PLACE TO STAY IN TOKYO FULL STOP !,"We have just come back from a stay In the Hoshinoya Hotel in Tokyo and I have to say it is on of the best hotel I have ever stayed in ! The location is spot on . It is right in the middle of the business area and the advantages of it is that you can travel around the city easily . But the best bits are the Hotel design and the Staff . If you are looking to be transported to Japan look no further . The Rooms are so well appointed , You get to wear a kimono both inside and outside if you wish ! No shoes please , tough for my wife who brought 10 pairs , but she did not mind a bit ! Try everything in the hotel , from the breakfast , the snacks when you come back from a long day of site seeing , to the evening show. Have a dinner in your room if you can , the food is just so",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A great ryokan experience,"This is the third time we stayed at Hoshinoya Tokyo. We stayed 12 nights this time. The room was luxurious, well maintained and clean as before. The hotel staff in general were excellent. Hot spring was very enjoyable. The rice balls and miso soup served as breakfast were very tasty. It would be great if the snacks in the lounge could be changed once a while. It was all the same items during our 12 nights there. One minor thing. We indicated that we were there to celebrate a birthday on the survey card during the check-in process, but the hotel did nothing this time. We were also at Hoshinoya Tokyo last year for a birthday and the hotel sent us a surprise gift which was very nice. Overall, I would highly recommend Hoshinoya Tokyo. We will definitely stay here",50,1

And decided we would stay at Hoshinoya Tokyo instead of our usual Ginza area hotels, and I am so happy we made that choice! The space is amazing, room was HUGE! Everyone is so attentive! There aren’t many rooms on each floor so it’s super quiet. The tea room is stocked with snacks, drinks, tea. They serve rice balls and handmade coffee in the morning. We would go sit there a while after our onsen session. Of course, onsen in the middle of the city? It’s so awesome! We walked so much while in. Tokyo, and it’s a great way to relax at the end of the day. During New Years, they would have yuzu in onsen, super refreshing. They provide milk from Hokkaido in dressing room.

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Pampered. Exclusive. Full Ryokan experience.,"Surprised Onsen in the middle of Tokyo, and the hotel is run like a Ryokan. Excellent and caring staffs that help you to solve problems in and out of the hotel. However, due to the number of foreign guests, the proper etiquette of using the Japanese onsen is sometimes not observed. It will be good if the staff can have a thorough explanation during the in-room check-in.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Absolutely the most exquisite ryokan stay of our lives. Every aspect was better than best. Enjoy. Period.,The staff was the best and most genuine we've experienced.

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Hoshinoya do it again!,"Another location and another Hoshinoya. Amazingly attentive staff, nothing was too much - even to the point of investigating requests without even asking! The investigation saved us wasted time and effort when we were going to go to the morning training of Sumo, the staff took it upon themselves to check if the session was going ahead. Shortcuts to stations, organisation of last minute taxis and genuine care during our stay was brilliant. The public onsen was a great experience (our first) and the hints guide provided was great to ensure we followed the right protocol. In-room breakfast was delicious (Japanese Style) and even when not possible - delivered the courtesy breakfast when our preferred time couldn't be met. Would highly recommend HOSHINOYA simply for the customer",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Great experience,"We had a wonderful stay at Hoshinoya Tokyo. Great authentic Japanese atmosphere with superb service and impressive onsen facilities.

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Little gem,"The hotel is located in the financial district of Tokyo only a 10 min walk from Tokyo Station. The minute you walk down the door you feel the tranquility and the peaceful feeling coming over you. You are zen once you step into the hotel entrance. The staff is of the utmost kindness, helpful and super friendly. Before going to the room you have to take off your shoes and they are stored in small lockers (one locker per room). The rooms itself are beautiful and completely decorated in Japanse style. They are of a good size (we had a corner) and spotlesly clean. There are even kimono to try on. We had breakfast (western style) twice (breakfast is served in the room) and although is was good and enough we found it quite expensive. Hotel Hoshinoya is definetely 5 star service",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Fabulous stay at Hoshinoya Tokyo,"Staying at a ryokan in the middle of central Tokyo was one of the best highlights of our visit to Japan. Wonderful service by the staff, snacks were provided and plentiful and of course the hot springs on the 17th floor! What an experience of a lifetime! I don't think we can stay at other hotels after our stay here at Hoshinoya.",50,1

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,a mindblowing experience - a Tokyo Ryokan in a high rise,"the stay at Hoshinoya Tokyo was one of the most exciting experience we had in our life / history of staying at exceptional hotels. the concept, the Ryokan, the gentleness of the staff, the services offered ( tea ceremony, for instance, or service at the floor common area) were just great experiences. Dining at Hoshinoya restaurant in basement 2 was somptuous: plates were superbly presented, very flavorful, attention to details was everywhere, worth a 3 star Michelin restaurenat in our eyes. the Onsen ( public hot bath at the top of the hotel , in the open air) is a magic place, helping one to unwind after a long day in the city, and linking you to a long japanese tradition. it makes you experience something no other hotel can offer. on each floor there ia s public space",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Magnificent Hotel!,"This modern style Japanese ryoken exceeded our expectations on multiple levels. We stayed for 4 nights in the Kiku (executive triple) room at 893 sq ft and it was like having your own home - maybe better! The service was impeccable and the entire hotel was amazing. The rooftop onsen was a truly unique experience. We were so spoiled that we would never stay anywhere else when visiting Tokyo. My only complaint is that there will never be another hotel experience anywhere that measures up. I travel a lot and this was my all time favorite hotel in my 55 years. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was like a spa, the decor and architecture was stunning. The amenities were 5 star. The private lounge was a welcome oasis. We felt like royalty. Thank you to everyone at the",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing Hotel,"I was worried I had built my expectations up too high prior to staying at the Hoshinoya but I came away wondering when I could book again. From the moment we arrived to leaving after 4 nights we couldn't have asked for more. The check in was personal and we felt at home right away, the lounge on each floor was perfect for drinks and nibbles after a day out in toyko. Rooms were a great size as we had lots of luggage and the bathroom/shower were very relaxing. Overall we had a great stay and are already looking to when we can visit again, highly recommend.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,This place elevated my 'Tokyo experience' to the next level,"I stayed at this modern-style Japanese ryokan for three nights on my trip to Tokyo. One of my main reason of staying here was that it is at the centre of Tokyo, near to the Imperial Palace and Tokyo Station. It was a huge bonus, as I found out, as it saved me plenty of time commuting around when visiting different parts of the metropolis. Most of the time I took the subway without the need of changing lines, or simply walked. I stayed at one of the basic level rooms on the 3rd floor. My room was spacious as expected and had a good flow. It was furnished with a mixture of both Japanese and western elements, such as tatami floor and a western bed. As a solo traveller, I certainly enjoyed making maximum use of the tatami floor space for all kinds of activities. The bathroom had a",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing Tokyo Hotel Experience,"We arrived into Tokyo Haneda (HND) with a few of our L.A. friends on American Air (AA 27) direct from LAX to HND. I arranged for a car service so we knew we would land and have a car waiting for us instead of having to navigate the train system – and who wants to have a long train ride after an 11+ hour flight?! We arrived at Hoshinoya approximately 40 minutes after leaving HND and arrived in the underground parking lot. From there, Hoshinoya staff greeted us and brought us up an elevator one story to the main entrance to Hoshinoya. Big, beautiful wooden doors open and you are immediately greeted by bowing staff dressed in traditional Japanese clothing. You leave your shoes at the door here and they are kept in little wooden boxes for you to retrieve each time you leave –",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Exceptional hotel.,"During our vacation in Japan we stayed 6 different hotels. Ranging from very traditional ryokans to top-end international luxury hotels. Hoshinoya Tokyo was our last hotel and we felt this was probably the best and most interesting hotel on this trip. I would describe it as a ""modern interpretation"" of a ryokan. But there are a few things you should know before deciding for this hotel. The place is exceptionally well designed and has a very boutique and discreet feel. The entire hotel can only be accessed by staying guests. In every floor there are 6 guest rooms and there is a lounge on every floor which can only be accessed by guests staying on this floor. Other public areas are a small lounge area at the reception level (with some evening performances and sake tasting) and",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Discreet, beautiful rooms, great service and convenient location.","Elegantly understated traditional style rooms with all modern amenities. The aura was peaceful and calming; the bed, pillows and comforter were like a cocoon which made it very easy to sleep after the Onzen! The staff were very helpful and the property was spotless everywhere. The Otenachi location was so convenient with 4-5 train lines just below the hotel. There were many food choices within 10 minute walk of the hotel but it was also easy to jump the metro to some of our old time favorite restaurants. Our main complaint is that the hotel is hard for the taxis to locate and our driver went in circles for 20 minutes even with GPS. The reason is that the hotel is in a pedestrian zone so one cannot drive right up to the lobby door. Also there is no signage to the carpark in",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Luxurious and private getaway,"A distinctive property that perfectly blends Japanese ryokan tradition with contemporary design. It is ideally suited for business and leisure travellers, being situated in Otemachi (CBD) and only a stone's throw away from historic areas like Nihonbashi and Ginza. The concierge team is brilliant and were such a wonderful resource in planning our dining engagements.",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Wonderful hotel and the ultimate fusion of contemporary and traditional Japanese experience,"We picked up Hoshinoya Hotel for it's unique ttaditional Japanese design. We didnt want to be in yet another hotel room while in Tokyo. But we were surprised above and beyond our expectations. The place is as beautiful as its web photos. The atmosphere inspires serenity and calm. The type that make you at piece and relaxed. The staff is amazigly helpful, personal and friendly. We felt at home and among friends. The hotel has a hot spring water onsen on the top floor - a great experience by itself. I can go on and on but I think that 5 stars is not enough for this unique establishment.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Fantastic traditional style hotel,"This hotel is run as a traditional ryokan, in the middle of busy Tokyo. The rooms make you believe that you can step outside of your room into a zen-garden... in spite of being on the 14th floor. Isolation is perfect, you don't hear a sound from outside (granted, Tokyo noise is nowhere near London or New York noise...). Everything was just perfect; the mini-tea-ceremony as a welcome, the gorgeous room with every facility you can dream of, a bath room so comfortable and well equipped that you want to stay forever. We had a breakfast in our room which was perfectly delicious. The smallest of downsides: not all the staff are fluent in English and the procedures tend to be (as often in Japan) a bit complicated.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,LUXE!!!,Everything and more! Ultra luxe and the service is unsurpassed. The onsen is next level leading out into an atrium which makes it really special. All staff beyond courteous and service was faultless. Loved our stay!,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Excellent accommodation, service and facilities","A unique hotel that offers you an entirely different hotel experience, like a mix of qualities from traditional ryokan and modern hotel, from excellent personal but quiet service, blend of Japanese elements in modern design, offers of hand-made rice balls and coffee in mornings, shared resting areas on every floor. We can feel the space, the heart that makes the difference. It’s only 1 station away from the Tokyo Station and 10 min away from the palace, and also connected to easy access to some other train routes, reasonably convenient.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,First Trip to Japan,Wanted a Japanese themed hotel and got more than what I was looking for. Also location is great as subway as connected to hotel and takes you everywhere. I never book the same hotel at a destinatiin the second time I vist but this hotel will be my first exception.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Disappointed,"I'll start with the good things. Location is convenient, directly connected to Otemachi station which has 4 different lines. Free Marunouchi shuttle bus can take you all the way to Hibiya. Lots of restaurants nearby (underground). Room is spacious by Tokyo standards, although there is no view to speak of. Like the concept of the lounge very much, almost feels like an extension of your room... Okay so what did I give it two stars? Well the service sadly lets it down. Partly my own fault as I should have known after the incident last time at Hoshinoya Kyoto... 1. I initially reserved 2 nights on the hotel website, later added 2 nights via an OTA. You wouldn't expect this to be a problem even for a Toyoko Inn...Somehow EVERYONE was oh so confused...After I told them about the 2",20,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing experience of Japanese culture in the heart of Tokyo,"Disclaimer: If you are looking for a classic 5 star hotel experience, do NOT stay here. The services they provide are not very flexible and is expected of Japanese hospitality: just sit back and relax. They'll do the deciding for you. I've been to Tokyo several times, and this is probably my best experience yet. I love the fact that they take away your shoes at the lobby, which keeps the place is extremely clean (I don't understand people who wear shoes in the house). The service is impeccable. All the activities and dining were well thought out, so it made the decision process very easy. As always with Japanese hospitality, there wasn't any fault to pick. Another note about the onsen: it is quite taboo to have tattoos in the Japanese culture and individuals with tattoos are",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Definitely a unique experience!,"This is a luxury ryokan experience that is very unique. The property has an eerie feel at night with some cool Japanese music in the dimly lit corridors. No shoes are allowed and you will be walking around in a kimono, which is pretty cool. There is a lounge on every floor offering light bites, the rice balls and miso soup offered for breakfast are more than sufficient. Staff are friendly and eager to please. The onsen at night is truly spectacular - be aware that no swimsuits are allowed and you must be naked! A bit embarrassing when other guests are around but hopefully you will have it to yourself. The downsides are unfortunately the hotel is extremely hard to find. No taxi drivers know how to find it even when you provide the address in Japanese! This is disconcerting when",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"We absolutely LOVED this hotel, Amazing experience!!","This was our first trip to Japan and Hoshinoya far exceeded our expectations. This is the place to stay If you are interested in design and Japanese culture or just want to relax from the hectic pace of Tokyo. The staff were all amazing and gave us great restaurant tips, travel advice and were proactive in making our visit to Japan so memorable.Thank you got the best hotel experience we have ever had!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Worst 5-Star Experience,"After 12 nights, I can state that this hotel is by far the worst hotel experience I have had so far in Tokyo and I would strongly urge you to think twice before staying here. First, more than half of taxis/cars I took for commute do not know where the entrance is as it is hidden at the basement of the car park. You enter on B2 and you have to go 1st Floor just to take off your shoes for them to keep (no shoes allowed in the entire hotel) before proceeding to 2nd floor reception. First image is not that great but since I knew it is a ryokan, I take the trouble. Then I realise there are no places for lunch nor a bar inside the hotel for a drink or some food. The restaurant inside is only open for dinner. Now about the room, I stayed in a Sakura double room. Dim lighting, no",10,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Unique experience. Not just a place to sleep.,"The hotel is in the heart of tokyo, yet very seclusive. Hoshinoya let you experience Japanese culture in a modernized ryokan style concept. Many activities let you indulge in japanese culture including Tea Ceremony (9,504JPY per person - including gift of ceramic tea cup set), Gagaku (Japanese ancient music - over 2,000 years), complimentary Sake testing etc. Staffs are all fluent in both english and japanese. I notice some staffs speak other languages too. They are all very attentive, helpful and professional. 84 spacious rooms are facilitated by about 50 highly productive staffs. Each floor has a common living with complimentary snacks and beverages including japanese beers, teas, etc. They refresh the bar simultaneously or upon request. Beddings and bath amenities are",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Best hotel in Tokyo.,This is without question the best hotel in Tokyo. Highly recommend. Location is amazing. Facilities are beautiful and calming. Staff is extraordinary. Look no further. This is the 5 star hotel you are looking for.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A Japanese Dream,"High end sophisticated modern Japanese experience. Fantastic. Made our visit to Tokyo special. Along with some very special sushi chefs & soba noodles…. Highlights: open-air hot spring rooftop bath (onsen). Large rooms, Yuri corner room. Nice design elements. All of the little unique things like rice balls for breakfast served in room or the common room, a room on each level serving drinks, tea and sumptuous rice flour red bean covered strawberries (mmmmm). Kimonos. Frequented by Japanese and fewer foreigners. It is expensive but well worth it. Tip: early bird 90-day booking = half price. Other favourite Tokyo spots Hoshinoya - Sushi Ya - Honmura An - Gonbei - Sushi Aoki - Joumon - Isegen. The site Black Buddha Tokyo helped us find these choice spots.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Pretty, bad.","Hotel is very nice looking but that is about it. The service was comically bad, truly undeserving of a 5 star rating. We stayed here for five nights, so there were many opportunities for us to change our minds but we kept being disappointed. The staff seemed amateur, disorganized and struggled with basic communication. We have previously stayed in five other hotels in Japan and communication has never been an issue, yet at Hoshinoya, there were several occasions when we made basic requests that were not understood (having our laundry picked up etc.). Upon checking in, we were told there would only be a ""light clean"" and that we had to request turndown service. We did so several times and never received it. In some cases, house keeping never showed up for the entire day. In",20,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Hands Down, Amazing","This place is just incredible. Someone is waiting at the entrance 24/7 to greet you. The snack and food bar on the floor of your hotel room is just beyond anything, with local snacks and nice expensive teas. The breakfast sets are to die for, and the full course dinner was beyond words. It was one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Its almost nice, but not to come back","stayed here for a week. It is indeed one of the prettiest hotels but not into detailing of service. amazing interior and sense of design yes. the architect has done a very good job. The room is basically so japanese, no shoes inside Its ok. but Im someone who like to change shoes everyday (esp in a rainy season), so they ended up keeping a few of my shoes there and every morning I need to tell them this one that one shoes. But this is a trait for those who has nerve foot pain, they will find this hotel is a torture. Staff did not explain much how to go to the station, none really bother, its 1kusd per night so you should be ok taking taxi right? seems thats how they potray the guests. But for us taking train is lovely. Sadly they fail to explain, when there is some connecting",30,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing hotel! Beautiful and authentic Japanese experience in the center of Tokyo!,Our stay at Hoshinoya Tokyo has been phenomenal. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Not an expense spared on anything. The design is contemporary and modern but they create a very welcoming authentic Japanese experience within the hotel. They provide pajamas and hotel wear which are luxurious and comfortable and kept us wanting to wear them. They provide morning meal in the common area or in the room. And every single person who works at the hotel was incredible. Cannot say enough great things about this hotel. Strongly recommend!!! We did also make our stay reservation far in advance at a non refundable rate and it was a total steal! Great cost savings!!!,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Exquisite to the the finest detail.,Everything about Hoshinoya Tokyo was perfect. The beauty of the decoration and the wonderful service get better with each day you stay here. A very impressive place to stay if you appreciate a traditional well crafted hotel.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!,"Hoshinoya Tokyo ranks among the best hotels I have stayed in. We wanted a luxurious hotel to celebrate a special occasion, but also wanted to feel that we were in Japan rather than just going to an American-style hotel. Hoshinoya, with its modern ryokan design and Japanese service, was perfect in this respect. From the moment you take your shoes off downstairs, you feel you are in another world. We loved the onigiri and miso soup breakfast and the Japanese snacks available in the lounges. The service was overall great as well. The location is amazing, right in the heart of Tokyo and with an entrance to the subway directly from the hotel. And perhaps the best part of Hoshinoya Tokyo is the amazing onsen and spa. I had an excellent massage with Yuko. My only complaint was that",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Urban Retreat,My first stay in a Hoshinoya property and it won't be the last. It is quiet sanctuary in the heart of Tokyo. It is well connected to an underground mall and train station. The limousine bus from the airport also stops just next to the hotel. The rooms are nice and the bed comfy. The common area is great for interaction for our group of friends. It felt like staying at home with great snacks provided. There's also sake tasting in the evening with a traditional show put up by a great artiste. It is a very exclusive hotel meant only for residents. So we can't bring friends into the rooms unless they are staying at the property. The onset at the top floor is amazing with an open roof top. All in all an amazing experience with great service. Can't wait to be back.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Modern Ryokan experience.,"Great facility, pricey for a reason, it is simply an elegant, excellent, modern take on the Ryokan experience. Rooms and facilities first class. Very comfortable and welcoming place to stay, which although it is a more business area, has easy access to transport and getting around the sights of Tokyo. The benefit is that the end of the day, you are out of the hustle and bustle of pumping parts of Tokyo",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Experiencing Japanese tradition in the heart of modern Tokyo,"Our stay in Hoshinoya Tokyo exceeded expectations at any level. We stayed for three nights, me, my partner and my 7 year old son. Even the kid was impressed big time. One must experience at least a stay at Hoshinoya if one loved Japan or Tokyo. The concept of Ryokan in a high rise building with perfection in everything. Oh where should I start? The people. The staff are amazing, they provide Japanese hospitality with kindness and gentleness. The establishment is also amazing. Cleanliness at its best, taking your shoes off before entering the premise is a Ryokan way of welcoming you home. The room, the bathroom is soooo beautiful and stylish, it kinda made us feel lazy to go out and just wanna cuddle up in the room. Not to forget they have a natural onsen on the 17th",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Urban Ryokan - Yes! Luxury Hotel - Not Quite...,"First, let me start by saying that we came with high expectations of Hoshinoya Tokyo prior to checking in this modern, high-rise ryokan located in the business district of Chiyoda. While almost everyone on TripAdvisor seems to rave about it, we were let down by a number of elements one would have expected from a supposedly premier hotel establishment: - Upon arrival by taxi at the lower level parking area, we were escorted by our greeter straight up to the floor where our appointed room was situated. Despite of our offer to lend a hand, the very cordial greeter insisted on hauling all bags and suitcases single-handedly along the journey. It made us feel very bad for our luggage was too heavy for any one person to carry, let alone a petite figure. It'd have been a far better",30,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Fantastic stay,What a great place. Fantastic facility. Not your normal hotel a Japanese Ryokan. Serene and peaceful with a beautiful Onsen. Couldn’t have been a nicer stay. Staff friendly and helpful. Comfortable rooms with a common living area on each floor to relax and enjoy,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Beautiful hotel in Tokyo,"This hotel is located right near a metro station, is easily accessible from Tokyo station. The imperial palace is just a short walk away, and lovely over the weekend. The staff are extremely helpful and the service is excellent. The rooms themselves are beautiful, with a modern interpretation of the traditional Japanese ryokan aesthetic. It is in a business district, so the view does mainly consist of other buildings, but it does still feel incredibly calm. There is a lounge on every floor, where snacks and drinks are provided free of charge, and breakfast was also available. The only downside was that the hotel was closing for scheduled maintenance, and I could only stay there for a couple of nights. I will definitely be staying again, and would highly recommend this hotel!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,The best hotel I've ever stayed in,"If I could live here, I would. The rooms, the level of service, the rice balls, the smell, the sounds, the welcome are all absolutely brilliant. Add to this the most glorious onsen with its oculus open to the sky (go when it's raining) and you have an even more exquisite hotel. The whole place feels very private and discreet, especially when slipping into the hotel from the underground. Tokyo is an incredibly energy filled place - this is your oasis of calm. The area surrounding the hotel is a little quiet at weekends, but it's not like Tokyo is lacking in things to do. P.S. I really loved the lift.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,By far the best hotel I have stayed at in the world,"The level of care and service at the Hoshinoya Tokyo was unparalleled when I saw there as a solo traveler for 7 nights in October 2018. There was a wonderful ratio of staff to guests. They really protect guest privacy by limiting visitors to the entrance and lobby only. Guests can only access their floor and the common areas. From the breakfast server in the living room, to the waitress at dinner and the entrance staff - they all knew what my plans were for the day because everything was noted down and carefully relayed to the other team members. They had suggestions for other activities, but also left me alone when I wanted to enjoy some downtime. The bedroom was super comfy and it really felt like I was staying in a much smaller hotel (I think that was the point of the",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Serene oasis in busy Tokyo,"Staying at the Hoshinoya Tokyo is like stepping into a cocoon of peace and tranquility. The indoor/outdoor onsen on the rooftop allows for complete privacy while looking up at the stars. The staff is extremely attentive. The hotel is connected to the Otemachi train station so you can stay out of the cold and rain while walking to the train. Breakfast was varied, either a small snack (onigiri and miso soup) or a full Japanese or Western style meal. Dinner at the restaurant is a real experience and probably the most beautiful meal I have ever had. Strongly recommend.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing Experience in Tokyo!,"That's all I gotta say! This hotel is perfection (cons don't compare to the pros)!! It's a peaceful sanctuary in the middle of Tokyo financial center buildings!! When you step inside, it feels like you are staying at Japanese ryokan complete with Tatami mat rooms. With the 24 hour private lounge outside our rooms, we always took time to relax before going up to the onsen. We tried both the Japanese breakfast - delivered and set up in one of the room and the onigiri simple breakfast with miso soup. Both are excellent! Didn't get to try the activities offered, but they all look very interesting. Pros: -Clean, modern, luxury -Professional services - I need to send luggages to my next destination hotel, the staff even come to my room with measuring tape, prices and take care of",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A quiet respite in the middle of the city.,"This hotel was incredible. The accommodations were very comfortable. Staff was so helpful. 5 star quality. Enjoyed using the onsen (hot springs) after a long day of touring. There was something so restful about taking off our shoes as soon as we entered that hotel and not having to walk through a big, busy lobby. The hotel was incredibly quiet and tranquil. Loved it.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,In-between a luxury hotel and a traditional ryokan,"We stayed here for 2 nights in a Kiku-room (executive triple) in late December. The experience was wonderful and we liked the peace and tranquillity, the zen-like design of the hotel and as well as the fantastic onsen on the top-floor. Nevertheless there are some things to consider and to improve, especially if you take the price into account that will also buy you a room at the Peninsula or Aman: - Hoshinoya is in the middle of the financial district, so there is not a lot to see or do in the immediate neighbourhood. Since we stayed here after a long flight from Europe it was perfect to relax and unwind but bear in mind that you will always have to walk a lot or take the subway to get to a more lively area. Especially during the weekends the area around the hotel is almost",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Tranquility in the middle of Tokyo,"We visited this hotel for two nights. It’s high end. Let me tell you what we really liked, and what was less to our liking. First, this is a very Japanese hotel. Most people move around in pajamas and a simple nightgown. Shoes are left at the door. There are only a few rooms on each floor and they share a little communal space where tea, coffee and some snacks are available. Staff assists with a simple rice ball breakfast in the morning. Everything is still and quiet, and most of the architecture is first rate and stunning, above all the entry hall (the ceilings in the bedroom were disappointing, everything else I loved). On the top floor there is an onsen bath. So all in all, this is a wonderful place to really wind down. Let me also tell you about the things we",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Wasn't expecting to be so impressed!,"This was the last of 4 places we stayed over a period of 2 weeks in Japan. All of the properties we stayed at were 5 star with 9+ traveler ratings. Our first place was amazing, our second wasn't quite as great, third was good, but not as nice as the first, so by the time we were going to Hoshinoya I actually considered canceling and instead booking with the first place we stayed just because we knew what we would be getting and we knew we loved the first place. I am so GLAD we didn't do that. Hoshinoya was amazing! And this was coming in sort of expecting to not like it. They blew us away. The staff was so friendly, the room was amazing (we did an Executive triple) amenties were great, everything was wonderful. I would definitely stay here again and wish we had more time there.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Wow, this zen oasis in Tokyo has a special place in our heart!!!","Love everything about this ryokan! They are such a perfectionist in endless surprises to delight the guests. Privacy is the key word here! We love the floor lounge and in fact, I spent a lot of time working from that place. We rarely run into other guests at the lounge because there is one lounge for six guest rooms. The onsen is the highlight and I use it twice a day. Make sure you book their restaurant. All the dishes were delicious and were the pieces of art!",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Good experience with some things to be improved,"This is a lovely experience. Other reviewers have commented on the many positive aspects of this property. We enjoyed the large rooms, powerful heating/cooling system, beautiful lighting and design, comfortable bed, great bathroom including tub, and the quality of staff. There were a few things that bothered us considering the price. - Rooftop onsen was very dirty and clearly hadn't been deep cleaned in a long time. Even the change room was messy with towels everywhere. The onsen was also very shallow and small, overall disappointing for what is supposed to be a ryokan style accommodation. - Sake hour (5-7pm in the lobby) is mediocre. The seating arrangements are awkward and exposed (not intimate or comfortable) and the juggling show is corny and not in keeping with the",40,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Exquisitely Japanese,We have stayed at many lovely Hotels in Tokyo and loved them but had always wanted to experience a more traditional Japanese space. This ryokan is a wonderful way to do just that. It is beautifully constructed - a poetic manifestation of Japanese culture and aesthetic. Here the traditional meets contemporary in understated perfection. You will need to leave your western expectations with your shoes when you arrive. You will find that gesture and mind shift worthwhile. The rooftop onsen with its floating oranges are a meditation on finding peace in the hum of a busy city. The beds are supremely comfortable in generous spaces. The bathing area glass that slides into opacity at the touch of a button is a technical delight. The in room dining from traditional boxes with icily,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,21st Century Ryokan Experience!,"This incredible hotel embodies the Japanese paradox of old and new. This ryokan-in-the-sky is housed in a non-descript modern office building with an almost hidden private entrance. When you first enter, it looks as if you have entered a science fiction movie - think the home of the tech billionaires in Bladerunner, minus any sense of grittiness. The hotel has only one main reception area (reached by elevator from the entrance area) and everything is organized by floor with each housing up to a handful of rooms and accessible only to the guests on that floor. Each floor has an extremely common lounge area with complimentary beverages and snacks, overseen by almost invisible staff, in essence their own little ryokan.

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Magical stay!,"If you need a relaxing getaway and want to experience true Japanese culture, stay here! I felt well taken care of, safe, and very relaxed at the Hoshinoya Toko. The staff is on top of everything! This is a Ryokan, so more of a place to stay at for the experience in the hotel. It is located in the financial district so things to walk to are not as exciting as you are in a business area. You are next to a major train station though so you can get out of the area very easily.",50,1

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Excellent hotel and hospitality!,"We had stayed at Hoshinoya Kyoto for one night, and it had cost us an arm and a leg, and we weren’t overly impressed. Hoshinoya Tokyo was a fraction of the price, and we preferred it so much more! We normally stay at Relais & Chateaux properties, but we loved our experience at Hoshinoya Tokyo. The service is stellar, and the staff really go out of their way to accommodate all your needs. The building is beautifully designed, intentionally dull from afar, but intricate upon close inspection. As it’s a newer hotel, all the amenities are top-notch and tech savvy, and the rooms are a combination of traditional ryokan design with modern comforts — we loved the large ceramic bathtub in our room! Each floor has around 6 rooms, and it’s own tea lounge, full of snacks and tea all through",50,1

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Unimpressive hotel asset,After all the hype about the place . One would assume this would have one upped amans urban asset in Tokyo . Boy was I wrong. I get the point that it is an “ experience “ but only if you never visited Japan prior you may be jaded by the fact it is amazing .

The Lobby is located at 2nd floor, so as we arrived at the entrance at Basement 2 we were greeted by the hotel staff and were escorted to Ground floor. Upon arriving at the B2 entrance the layout was quite usual, as in other hotels. Upon arriving at the entrance at Ground floor, I was quite impressed as there were 3 female staffs dressed in Japanese traditional costumes greeting us in Japanese way and they are quite fluent in English too. The check-in process at Lobby level was easy and fast, thought at that there were many guests being served as well. The guest room was spacious, though it was the smallest type (Sakura Type) we picked. There was also separate shower room and bath tube (as some",50,1

The ice cream balls, senbei, nuts and red bean mochi were some of our favourites. I liked the variety of tea provided as well. The location of the hotel is not too bad with four different lines close to the hotel. Tokyo station is about 11 mins away by foot.",50,1

Everything was amazing and exceeded our expectations, however worth citing the wonderful hotel staff and their unparalleled customer service orientation. Hoshinoya Tokyo has been the best way to truly live Japan! We will be back. We loved everything! Staff was super, the setting and environment were superb, cleanliness was spotless (as everywhere in Japan to say the truth), our room was wonderful with excellent amenities offered, facilities were excellent. The hotel is in the business district, close to Imperial Palace. It is excellently connected as there are 4 different metro lines just below the structure. Easy to reach",50,1

Staff at property is very helpful, where top that is GM and main office were simply useless. Hotel made an exception to accept my group, but we had to pay double the rate which I guess is fair enough, but we did expect Hoshinoya service, but we got half the price service I guess from top of the Hoshinoya. As travel agent I rather avoid such headache and choose property which appreciate our business. Still property is worth staying at least once, experience here is something different, staff is trying hard. There are small things which you can see Hoshinoya is being cheap...compare just silly umbrella at any Hoshinoya property to Suiran",30,0

TIP - if you want a break from eating out and room service, head to Daimaru's basement food centre at Tokyo Station for high quality take-home meals - everything from sensational french pastries to full meals from Paul Bocuse.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Absolutely Devine,"As our first stop on a two week long Japan adventure with my daughter-in-law and granddaughter we were delighted with the Hoshinoya in every way. The room was large and comfortable for three. The futon/beds were luxurious and very plush. The bathroom was also large and had a shower and soak tub. We enjoyed room service for the Japanese breakfasts. The ""living room"" attached to each floor was a high point. Cookies, dried fruit, tea and coffee were always available. We also loved the rice balls and ramen for breakfast. The Marunouchi line is right under the hotel so travel to and from Tokyo station was a breeze. We highly recommend their Onsen. A beautiful pool open to the sky with a lovely lounge to change and shower in. The staff was so kind we left them a box of cookies! The",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Suitable for the 'wanting to relax and do nothing' traveler,"I totally understand everyone giving this hotel 5 stars but it all is dependent on the traveller. It is important to note that the hotel is not near a JR line (closest being Tokyo Station) and when you stay during the weekend 95% of surrounding restaurants and businesses are closed :( PROS -Staff were absolutely amazing! -Onsen was unique and sooo relaxing -They put on shows Fri-Sun (refer to hotel) which was a nice added surprise -You have your own little communal lounge area to chill, help yourself to the snacks and drinks -Rooms were spacious and beds sooo comfortable CONS -Completely understand taking off your shoes and happy to do so in my room. However you have to take your shoes off at the main entrance. Which they then store. I just find it a hassle every time I leave",30,0
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Hot spring in the middle of the city,"It was such a friendly atmosphere. Service is impeccable. Rooftop hot springs which had an open air area was amazing. Loved staying here. The complimentary breakfast was delish. Good location bc you get easy access to the subway but it was hard to find on the first day we arrived and the can drivers didn’t know the location / entrance of the hotel well. The rooms are beautiful but bc it is situated amongst high rise skyscrapers in the financial district, I couldn’t open my windows. Had the shades down a lot.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,"Good díseño, comfort and elegance",a quiet and elegant space with comfortable rooms to disconnect after a busy city tour. Great service and excellent restaurant where to experience explosion of flavors. Its staff is very friendly and attentive to the smallest detail,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,The best in Tokyo if you want to stay in Japanese luxury,"Hoshinoya is a real Japanese luxury hotel. Each floor functions as its own separate hotel with its own staff, tea kitchen/lounge and only 6 rooms, that are spacious and well equipped and has real beds. In the cellar you have one of Japan’s best restaurants reserved exclusively for the guests and at the top floor you have a Japanese bath. When you enter the hotel you leave your shoes at the door and in your room you will find a pyjamas to wear when you walk around on your floor, a kimono you can wear if you go somewhere else and a coat if you go outside. Room service is delicious and served in the tea kitchen (except for the breakfast) and always in exclusive bento boxes and decorated to a very high standard. This is true Japanese Luxury.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Absolutely Perfect,A perfect 2 nights in Tokyo. From start the finish this was a very special stay. Extremely personal and almost homely with service that is absolutely seamless all at the same time in being in a high end large city hotel. Highly recommended.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing zen experience highlighting best of Japanese hospitality,"Seeing all of the Hoshinoya's reviews and online collateral, I had very high expectations coming in and the Hoshinoya exceeded them all. Pristine hotel, incredibly relaxing, attentive staff. Really enjoyed the smaller extras like a simple rice ball breakfast, milk after the Onsen and a bevy of unique snacks. One of the most unique hotels",50,1

A heaven in the middle of the financial district, 5 minutes from Ginza.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,In Tokyo luxury,We stayed one night before leaving Japan. It was all we could have expected from a modern ryokan. Facility food and service were outstanding. We had only the one night there and wished it had been more as we enjoyed ourselves so much while there. The public bath unique for me as it a top floor inside/ outside setting with the outside looking up a three story shaft to the sky. We had a star lit nightcso it was amazing.,50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Amazing!!,"Simple. Great. Just, the only thing I would change is maybe have an option to reserve the onsen. However, the staff were friendly and I recommend coming here. It was peaceful and quiet, and the quality met our expectations.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A Japanese Ryokan Experience in the Heart of Tokyo,"I was staying at Hoshinoya Kyoto back to 2013 and became a big fan of Hoshinoya brand. It is always on my priority list while I traveling in Japan (unfortunately there are very few branches by Hoshinoya in the rest of the world). Finally I had a chance to travel in Tokyo in Jul. 2018 for my birthday trip and this time I decided to experience the accommodation at Hoshinoya Tokyo, one of very few Hoshinoya hotels that located in the downtown city. The hotel location is very good that close to Tokyo Station. If you take a taxi it would be less than 5 min from Tokyo station to Hoshinoya. I was walking to the hotel therefore spent more than 20 min. on the way. This walking distance to the Tokyo station makes you easy to have a look at the famous Tokyo station and the",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Not what we expected,"We have been to Tokyo over 10 times and have always stayed in 5 star hotels such as; The Ritz-Carlton, Peninsula, Palace Hotel etc. We are accustomed to service and quality. This hotel is beautiful and serene and thought the Hoshinoya would be a different experience but did not meet to our standards. I understand English is not the native language but they need to have some staff that understands and speaks some English. We found ourselves repeating the same questions over and over again and eventually gave up. The staff did try very hard. Another issue, is that you do not have a business center or a concierge in which we could get recommendations. It took us one hour to have our boarding passes printed and half an hour it get metro directions to Harijuki. The other",10,0

They have breathing classes in the morning , sake service from 5 to 7 pm . Very clean n tidy , once u check in , no shoes allow . A bit pricy but worth once in ur life .",50,1

The rooms are beautifully designed, spacious and very comfortable. The decor creates a feeling of enormous well-being. The staff are excellent - fantastic service and attention to detail. Nothing is too much trouble. Location is very good - Tokyo station around 10 minutes walk away and Otemachi station entrances across the road.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Traditional and Contemporary in one place,"Extreme attention to details, from design to service, this is a great choice for someone looking to relax and for some visual and sensorial inspiration. Also, greatly designed onsen (part of it is open-air) located on the 17th floor.",50,1
HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Minimalist Perfection,"Hoshinoya Tokyo brings me joy. It was a beautifully curate ryokan. Modern and sophisticated interior. Think of a minimal place to be, with ample of space and well placed and chosen furniture. I love the natural feel of it. The staff were very kind and friendly. We feel very much welcome. We had the 14th floor room, it had a onset bath and a lounge room. More space than we ever need. We checked in at night :) I’m in love with the cushions and ceramic ware! The next morning we were treated to a delicious Japanese breakfast (there is also a western option for those craving bacon and eggs). Beautifully presented, a flatlay perfection. There were a range of little breakkie treats to try from miso soup to sesame pudding. We were spoilt for choice! Thank you for a modern ryokan",50,1

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Peaceful. Thoughtful. Wonderful,"Had a fantastic week-long stay at Hoshinoya while in Tokyo on business. Every detail was special - from room, to service, to snacks in the lounge. It was a great experience and a peaceful respite from the heat and crowds in downtown Tokyo. There were restaurants in the area but the room service was lovely as well. Having a subway stop in the building was convenient - but the staff was always willing to book a taxi as well. Overall, I highly recommend and will stay again on my next trip!",50,1

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,Lovely stay,"The entire hotel smells amazing! The staff is terrifically friendly, the onsen is beautiful, and the common area is a welcoming touch. The only things that could be improved upon are the room key (the size is inconvenient to carry about) and the lighting in room (I would have appreciated a way to have a bit more lighting in the room when getting ready in the morning).",50,1

HOSHINOYA Tokyo,A must for a complete experience,It was a major highlight to our trip. If this will be your first time visiting Japan and you want to take in the full experience then staying here is a must. We fell in love with this modern ryokan and will definitely stay here again either at this location or other. It is on the same block as the train station which we used daily to get around Japan.,50,1
