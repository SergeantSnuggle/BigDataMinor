I really liked this hotel. It was fun and had such an amazing time. The food was great and the staff was amazing. The view was also truly amazing and I am sure to book this hotel again,8
I didn't like this hotel. The reason is that the staff wasn't so friendly and the other hotel quests were quite loud. The location was good but that cons outweigh the pros for me,4
Staff good. Room good. Price was to high. Pool was nice and cold and had a great view of the hotel,7
"First of all let me say, i enjoyed my stay at this hotel. But there were a few points that weren't to my liking. The first point was the coffee at the breakfast, is was cold and way to weak for my liking. Second point is the staff took way to long to come and deliver my bags, I had to wait for 10 minutes! And my third point is that the beds were a bit to hard for me. I wouldn't book at this hotel again",6
"This hotel is indeed a 10. Sits at the heart of Tokyo, beside the Imperial Palace just few minutes away from Tokyo Station. We had the Grand Deluxe Room with Balcony and it is the nicest room we ever had so far. Perpetually clean, great amenities, excellent breakfast, great service, well-trained staff who are definitely can communicate in English and the VIEW!",10
"Right in the center of Amsterdam. Great view of the city and a good connection to the public transport. The food could be improved a bit tho, was a bit cold sometimes",8
"The room wasn't clean at all. When we entered the room we could already smell the stench, it was horrific. We found out that the bathroom wasn't clean and still had marks of the previous guests, YUCK. We did get an upgraded room as compensation which was nice. But entering your hotel room after a long flight and having to deal with that stuff isnt't that nice",5
Great hotel. Not much in regards of services but works nicely for the price and location. Doesn't speak alot of English but it works.,8
The location was a bit far from the station but the rooms made up for it. The rooms were really big for the price and the amenities were great. Would stay again,7
The bed was squeaky and the pillow were to soft for me. I didnt like this hotel that much,3
"Why do other people say so much good stuf about this hotel? My stay was absolutely horrific, there wasnt a thing that went right with this hotel. Breakfast was only one piece of bread and some jam. yuck",1
"I don't think this is a five star hotel, more like 3 1/2 stars. We stayed in the second largest room. The carpet should be replaced and the room smelled.. a bit old? The lobby smells nice but the room smelled a bit musky. The room had a kitchen, but no pots or pans and the microwave was ancient. However, the service was good and the room's private garden and hot tub were so nice.",7.5
Such an amazing hotel with luxury rooms. Staff was so friendly.Rooms are so clean and well organized. The breakfast was delicious,10
"""Garden dining"" disappoint me. Too small portions in the buffet and sometimes an annoyed tone from the staff at the counters",6
"I loved the room, the room service was excellent, the amenities was good except for the bowling alley which was really hot idk if the AC was broke but it was really hot inside. Overall experience was great!!!",9
"The room was The carpet was disgusting, I dropped something and when I reached it it had lots of women’s hair. Then I looked closely and the carpet was sticky full of hairs, like it was never washed before. The bathroom shower was a bit clogged so when I took a shower, all of the bathroom was wet. When I complained they offered me a drink at the downstairs bar... I don’t really have such high standards but a hotel room being clean is a basic, specially for a 5 star hotel",5
"Nice and fluffy bed. Haven't slept so good in years. Thanks! Location was also good, nice and quiet",9
"Who would even go to this hotel? Even if I would get payed i would never step my foot inside this dirty hotel. Staff was depresed and it stank everywhere, like the sewers were coming up blergh",1
Hotel and room looked really nice. But the location is just not good. Next to a highway and really bad noise insulation. The entire night i heard the highway and i couldn't sleep because of it. If you are planning on coming to this hotel bring some earplugs. For me this was my first and only time I came here.,4
"AMAZING VIEW!!!!! Waking up and seeing the alps is just so romantic and relaxing. I would stay here my entire life if I could. But sadly its kind of expensive, so that dream will not be reality. Im going to save up money for my next return, I want to stay here longer!",10
