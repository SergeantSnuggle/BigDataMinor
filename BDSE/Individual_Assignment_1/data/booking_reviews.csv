8.0,"The breakfast, kept running out of food, staff running round like headless chickens, tables not cleared.  Great location  ",1
9.0,"Nothing that I can think of right now.  Conveniently located in the city center of Amsterdam. Quiet and clean room. The size of the room is not big but the furniture is carefully designed that even a proper work desk is fitted.  ",1
8.0,"The bathroom inside of the room lacks privacy. It didn't even have a real door, just a glass barrier type of thing. The room rate is more on the expensive end.  Great location at the heart of Amsterdam city center. The hotel overall is clean and comfortable, the staff was very helpful, and the room was adequately equipped.  ",1
9.0,"The view from the window faced a wall/another window which as I had booked so early in advance thought i would of been allocated a better room, also when we arrived to check in our room wasnt ready which is fine as it was 9am and check in wasnt until 3pm but when we came back the lady on reception looked like she hadnt allocated us a room as we were there for 10/15mins and she was going in and out of the office area to speak with someone and eventually gave us a room when we should of just been handed keys, also when I left the card on the door for the room to be cleaned we left and came back and it hadnt been cleaned approx (6hrs) which was ok but the cleaner did knock and we left again to let them clean the room, came back and it didnt look or smell like it had been cleaned, the bed was just bearly made and towels were changed. This was the onl  Staff were very friendly and very apologetic about the issue with the room when checking in, the location was great the room was a decent size, quiet enough hotel but could enter and leave as we pleased, the t.v worked and had multiple channels, would definately stay again.  ",1
9.0,"No complaints really.  Central location. Very clean and tidy and quite modern. Staff were very accommodating, and I had great assistance from a staff member called Diago who was always available for help. My room was quite small but was very clean with a modern bathroom. Key card access for guests and coffee available all day at reception area. Really close to central station and surrounded by lovely bars restaurants etc.  ",1

7.9,Staff are nice  Not far from the centre  ,1
9.2,For the price I really have no complaints or issues  Location of this hotel is perfect - 5 mins from Amsterdam Central station with loads of bars and restaurants all around.....nothing we wanted to see or visit was more than a 20/30 minute walk away. Our room was clean and the beds were really comfortable.....cannot comment on the food as we ate out every meal.  ,1
8.0,"Size/shape of room - very little room to move around the bed. Bathroom very much the same. Room was very warm, even with window open it was stifling  Staff were nice and polite. The cleanliness of the hotel and the room could not be faulted. Location wise its ideal  ",1

7.0,I like everything  Every Thing  ,1
9.0,The first room we was given (210) a small window that looks out to nothing dull & dark room spoke with staff and got moved  Friendly check in staff nice and easy check in Being moved to another room  Bathroom was lovely  Modern rooms  Comfy bed  Toiletrys in room  Light and airy room  Room was a little small but normal for Amsterdam and your not in them long  ,1

8.0,"Location was excellent.    5 minutes walk to Dam Square & Central Station.  Conveniently located, close to all amenities.   Staff at the hotel were very friendly and accommodating.  ",1
7.0,Very friendly stuff and very close to the central train station.  ,1
8.0,"Nothing really!  We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment of food. Location is 5 minute walk from Amsterdam Central train station and 5 minutes from De Wallen so for those wanting to visit bars, coffee shops, red light district along the canals its ideal. Room was small but adequate, we ended up with a twin room but the beds were together so virtually a double. Pillows a little sof but overall comfortable. Bathroom was seperated from the main room by frosted glass so if you want/need privacy not ideal! We visited in January and for 2 nights paidjust over £200, however it will cost more at other times of the year.  ",1
8.0,"The hotel was located very central to shops, train station, trams and restaurants. The breakfast was a buffet and there was a great choice. Also i would like to mention that all the staff we met were very friendly and helpful.  ",1
8.8,The location it was perfect  The property was in a great location. It is a 10-15 mins walk to the main part of Amsterdam and 10 mins to either Dam Square or the Train station. Perfect location  ,1
8.0,"The first Day we arrived to the hotel late at night the person who was at the front desk I would say not has attitude when he noticed that we had a problem with the payment, that was a really bad impresión at the first sight, the room was not cheap so he could have a better attitude and helped us to fix the problem. After some days I change my mind as I found other person of the staff very mind with us.  The location was a good point, its near to the central station, the breakfast was good, the room a little bit small but confortable, a little overpriced but good.  ",1
8.0,"Our room faced a type of a courtyard.  On arrival we requested a street facing room... wasn't available though.  On the other hand, that caused our room to be quiet - which my friend really liked.  The only thing that really bothered us was that some other guests were smoking weed in their room.... and we could smell it in the corridor on the first floor.  The hairdryer in the bathroom (although standard in hotel rooms) is really not very good - especially if you have long curly hair... it takes ages.  Maybe the hotel can keep an extra (stronger) hairdryer at reception?  Second time that I stayed at Westcord.  It is a lovely hotel.  Location is excellent.  Love the smell of the hotel as one enters from the street... clean and fresh. Comfortable lounge.  Good wifi.  Room was comfortable.  Staff very friendly.  I will definitely stay here again.  ",1
8.3,The glass toilet amplifies every sound through the room we found it very invasive to each other you can see through the frosted glass. Could also have been given a map for the area  Location was perfect. Bed very comfortable. Staff polite approachable helpful and friendly would probably stay there again  ,1
7.1,"The rooms were small and the ensuite was glass walled, the room was very small and but came with exorbitant price for what you get. Having said that the rooms were very clean. Also disappointing to see that management don't respond to reviews . So I am not sure of the value of this review or all the others  Good central location and the lady on reception was very friendly and welcoming. Short walking distance to shopping areas, bars and restaurants and the train station is only a 5 minute walk.  ",1
9.6,Didn’t like we couldn’t control room temperature.  Loved the way u were able to borrow an umbrella when it was raining.loved the free flavored water.loved the friendliness of staff at reception.  ,1
7.5,Room layout was tight for dealing with luggage.  Twin beds were a bit too firm/hard.  Convenient location. Elevators!  ,1
8.0,Rooms are very small.  The location  ,1
9.2,"Location is perfect for all areas. 5 minutes from the Station. And two minutes from the centre of the city'. It's also right among the local shopping area and both Red and Green light district's.  The Hotel bed was really comfortable  and allow the rooms are small, they are fresh and clean with good room service. Never had to ask for anything other than an Iron and board witch is located on the first floor but there's many so you can take one to your room. Enjoyed this Hotel very much and would recommend it as I've paid the same for ones no were near as clean or better located. Also an area for juice and other drinks in the ground floor. Umbrellas are also provided by the hotel.  My wife also loved it and she isn't the easiest to please as she was a maid and expects the same quality she would leave in her rooms witch isn't always the case. Perfect place for couples. Facing the police station so it's also really good for saftey at night if you have to go outside to smoke. And the Chapel right behind is a beautiful building designed by the same person who designed Amsterdam Central Station. Accessible through a lane just beside the Hotel. Places like Dam Square and Ann Frank's House are also just 5 and 10 minutes walk too.  Definitely recommend  ",1
8.0,We got locked in our room! The door knobs were new and so stiff we couldn’t turn them! Had to change to another room.  The bed was comfy. The breakfast was very nice.  ,1
9.6,No room service  Location  ,1
8.8,"Great location, nice room, great service - real value for the money - we will return!  ",1
7.1,"Not value for money.Corner room which has movement limitations Snacks available by using card only. No option for cash Rooms daily change was towels only. No bins emptied on 2 occasions. Bed not made on one day. The room did not feel as if it was serviced every day. 3 small coffee pods for two adults is not enough!I felt as if the cost for the stay should have included breakfast but it was another 18 euro on top which was not value for money.  Location was very good.  ",1
6.7,"Rude staff upon arrival. We questioned our charges and were made to feel as if we were in the wrong, staff that dealt with query was very rude, patronising, not apologetic at all. When eventually we checked into our room there was a bottle of water & confectionary as an apology. We booked this hotel on the understanding that charges were 'pay when you stay' , booking secured by debit card details were charged a large sum a week before our stay & an unknown additional charge on checkin. One member of staff stated this would be refunded, and another member said not, that they could only refund to a credit card, clearly ludacris. Overall really unimpressed & would certainly not stay there again.  Location  ",1
7.5,"Size and layout of room. So small with desk area taking up much of the space. Terrible view from room 301 , enclosed within building, little to no natural light. Bathroom with restricted privacy - see through screen, big gaps round door.  Location and staff were excellent  ",1
9.2,"My only dislike was I asked for a double bed but it was 2 single beds pushed together with 2 single duvets on the bed  The hotel was so central to everything 3 min walk you where at central station and if you crossed the road within a minute you where beside all the shops.the staff was so friendly and helpful I would definitely stay here again  ",1
7.9,"Location. Everything squeezed into my room, but great time.  ",1
6.7,It was 3 Star not 4 Star as advertised. A lot more expensive than other Hotels that friends stayed in at the time . This was for International football match.  Good location  ,1
8.3,"Room was small compared to other hotels we had been before in Amsterdam. And the price was quite exorbitant. It was our anniversary, and we availed of the Romance package. The rose petals they made as decoration were made of plastic 🙄. The chocolates were nothing especial. So to make it short, we were not really impressed.  The hotel rooms can do a bit of upgrade.  The staff from reception and the breakfast room were friendly,  accommodating and polite. The location was superb. Facilities were within standard just like any other hotels in Amsterdam. Cleanliness was excellent. The devil worked hard but the cleaning staff in this hotel worked harder. Breakfast was satisfying and fresh produce were provided everyday.  ",1
7.1,"My daughter and i were informed when we arrived dead tired around 10 pm that the hotel was over booked so we were taken by cab (paid for by the hotel) to snother branch of the hotel, far from the city center. We spent one night there. We moved to the city center branch the next day by cab (paid for by the hotel).  We were given complementary wine and nuts upon arrival and free breakfast every day. The tray, glasses and plate were left in the room the following day, the room was not cleaned properly. However the front desk/reception were very nice. Cleanliness left a lot to be desired.  ",1
7.9,"I wasn't keen on the outlook from the room but this could of been because I requested a low floor I also booked the room due to the quirky glass bathroom wall design, I didn’t get this though  I liked that the hotel was really central to the city without being in the thick of it. They also honoured my request for a low floor room and double bed instead of 2 singles  ",1
8.3,Very small room.  No place to sit comfortably.  Location  ,1
7.9,"The door nob from  inside the room is very hard to open. There's mold on the shower wall. The bed is facing the wall instead of the window, which makes us feel claustrophobic  The location and excellent reception services. All staffs are friendly and helpful  ",1
7.0,"I don’t like the Toilets setting,too too small space! The shower door can’t fully  closed, the water spray out of shower pan.  ",1

7.9,"Poor room layout Nowhere to unpack - had to put cases on bed and then on floor to sleepBed poorly positioned  Staff very helpful and friendly  ",1
8.3,"The rooms I had were a little wired, the bathroom was good, breakfast was nice though  was a little experience. Staff was very nice and collaborative  ",1
8.3,Room sizes are small and  you need to redesign the toilet area  Nice location  ,1
7.9,"The room was tiny - a real struggle for 2 women with a lot of luggage. The room was so poorly designed - we barely had room to move around, there was almost no storage space, the pillows were horrible (so soft they provided no support and I woke up with a terrible neck ache), there wasn't a single shelf in the bathroom and the bathroom was all frosted glass so there was no privacy. I know Eurpoean rooms are smaller than what we typically have int he US but this was exceptionally small and poorly designed.  The hotel was lovely, breakfast good and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The location was excellent - walking distance to the Anne Frank house, waterfront, canal cruises and main square.  ",1
8.5,Very squeezy room! No fridge in room. Difficult to move around suitcases as so small  Excellent central location! Staff very responsive with requests for ice buckets. Quite reasonable price given very busy in town for GayPride March early August 2019. Would recommend.  ,1
8.8,"Rooms are rather small,  Didn't like the bathroom opaque glass door  Very good breakfast.  Very clean everywhere.  Friendly, helpful staff  ",1
9.2,"Room was a little smaller than expected. Could of just been the luck of the draw to be honest.  Excellent location, close to all shops, cafés, bakeries and bars etc!  ",1
7.5,"The room had minimum storage space for clothes, underware and other personal  belongings. Specially for longstay of two. Carpets ask to be replaced.  The location was excellent for tourists. Tea & coffeemachine in the room, microwave oven in lobby. Friendly staff.  ",1
9.2,We had a few issues with the AC and the staff took care of it right away.  ,1
8.3,"Hotel is pricey i found rap when breakfast is not included in our price.  Rooms very quite and curtains were totally black out. Superb location. Very friendly staff, stores our luggage while we we waiting for our time to leave for the airport.  ",1
8.3,The beds were singles pushed together  The room was nice staff really accommodating. Great central location.  ,1
7.9,The room was a little small .  The bed was comfy and the location fantastic .  ,1
9.6,Nothing. All great.  Excellent service from friendly staff. Nothing too much trouble.  ,1
8.3,"I booked two rooms, one shower was cork and overflown to lower level.  The staff solved the problem effectively and changed the room for us.  ",1
8.3,"The beds comfortable, the breakfast was plentiful and a good choice, coffee was good, staff in restaurant were very obliging  ",1
7.1,"Beds facing the wall???And a desk cramped between the headboard and the window? Very difficult to move in the room. Vu  Nikita at the front desk was AMAZING, from check in to checkout simply also std at the ho because she lets her light shine constantly, is obvious that she loves what she does some friends that stayed at the hotel experienced the same. Well done Nikita and thank you!!!  ",1
8.8,"Wasn’t worth the price I paid  Great location, Staff were very friendly and helpful  ",1
8.3,"No fridge in the room. Smell coming up from the toilet, not very pleasant. Air conditioner comes on automatically at night and in the morning. Need to get up to turn it off. Light switches on the headboard and so pillows turn lights on when you’re in bed.  All staff are extremely polite and welcoming. They always greet You with a smile and are always happy to serve you. Nothing was too much.  Very central location. Close to shopping areas, restaurants, supermarket, Dam, tramline, Central Station. In other words, really great location!!! The room is a reasonable size. Great for one person. Ok for two! Decent view of the local area from the room.  Flavoured water available in the reception. Ice available from the desk. Storage for luggage, should you require it. More things/refreshments available to purchase in the reception.  Breakfast available but rather costly. Recommend going to Irish pub for great breakfast at €11.  ",1
7.5,Hotel was very central with nearby carpark  ,1
7.9,"rooms are tiny for 2 people, had to walk sideways to get around the bed to get past  location is perfect  ",1
9.6,Very central! Amazing staff!  ,1
8.3,The room was oddly set up. The bed position was strange.  The location was absolutely fantastic for walking around Amsterdam.  ,1
6.7,Small room and small bathroom(glass wall).  No fridge to keep milk for tea and coffee.  Close to all the facilities and clean.  ,1
8.3,I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff were lovely and overall it was very comfortable. Would definitely recommend.  ,1
9.2,"Layout of the room  The hotel’s location is excellent , very close to major attractions. The tram stop is just outside. The staff is friendly and the breakfast is good.  ",1
7.9,the check starts from 2-3 pm  ,1
9.6,"Door handle on bedroom door was sticking and we couldn't get out of the room, we reported it but said nothing could be done until the next day. If there had been a fire it would have been very dangerous.  Great location, friendly staff  ",1
7.9,"The artwork on the walls does not set a professional tone.  Also, the shower had either rust or mold around one edge.  However, everything else was clean.  There is a kettle in the room, good AC which is needed during the summer, and a very accommodating staff.  The location was very good.  It's near Amsterdam Central, near Dam Square, and many attractions.  It,s also on major tram lines, so navigating Amsterdam from the hotel was easy.  This is a decent, basic hotel in a city of very high priced hotels.  ",1
8.3,Wasn't much room in our room  Great location  ,1
9.2,"Hated the Glass walled shower and toilet. Strange lighting arrangement sometime the shower lights would turn on and sometimes they would not  Great location, nice air conditioning, good room  ",1
8.8,the room I stayed in had a flat roof that held water out side my window. The mold from standing water made me ill.  did not have breakfast there.  ,1
7.5,"Cleaning could be better. Lack of privacy with the bathroom glasses.  Well located, very convenient to all city center tourist points.  Reception very helpful  ",1
8.3,"The cleaning personel not so good, in four days no toilet roll was replaced, no box tissue was replaced and not even the shower gel in the shower was replaced and we even removed it from the shower to show that it needed to be replenished, they just put it back empty. Not even bothered to sweep the bathroom floor. Not very pleased with that.  Staff helpful and nice, room very small for 2 persons, bed & pillows comfortable, tv channels very good, shower very good, air condition very good, small shop in reception good. Lovely stay.  ",1
9.2,Would have been good to have a bar.  Good location. Lovely clean air conditioned rooms. Good breakfast.  ,1
8.3,"Nothing really to fault, you are getting what you pay for and we were happy with our stay.  The hotel was in the perfect location for the station, dam square, red light district. Tram station right outside the hotel too which was great. Rooms are small but that’s too be expected, not much space to move around but that didn’t bother us in the slightest as it was only a place to sleep. Would definitely stay at this hotel again if returning to Amsterdam and would recommend it to anyone.  ",1
8.3,No fridge in room.  Lovely dark room and good shower. Great location to explore Amsterdam.  ,1
8.3,"Clean and tidy hotel. The staff is very courteous and pleasant. The location is good but not excellent. The rooms are clean but very small. The shower is clean and comfortable but very small. Were it not for the size, the score would have been much better.  ",1
7.9,Rooms are quite small  Excellent location and friendly staff  ,1
7.5,Pretty good location. Room was very small but sufficient for one person. Restaurants all around and walking distance to the canals. 10 min drive from Amsterdam central station  ,1

8.8,"Could be a bit cleaner, and it's not the cheapest.  Location is perfect. Nespresso machine in all rooms. Staff was friendly. It was a good trip and would definitely consider staying there again.  ",1
7.5,"Need to upgrade hotel hardware, Like Bathroom facilities, carpet cleaning.  Convenience, just 10 mins walking distance from Amsterdam Central Station. The best location we would like to recommend and with competitive / reasonable rate.  ",1
9.2,"The bed is in such a weird location in the room, just didn't feel able to relax property with the bathroom door right behind your head.  ",1
9.6,"Breakfast not included as with other hotels  Perfect Location, Helpful and friendly staff  ",1
8.8,Pillows to soft and had to keep asking for English Breakfast tea bags and the room was pretty cold.  ,1

7.5,"N/a  Central, reasonable price  ",1
7.1,"Our room was very small. Breakfast was not included in the price, it wasn't a cheap rate for the room either so was surprised breakfast would be extra.  The location, was close to all amenities.  ",1
7.5,You cannot control the heating in your room... Reception either turn on for the whole building or not at all hence one night freezing the next boiling  Friendly staff comfortable bed nice and clean  ,1
7.1,"single bed with single bed covers when I asked for a double.the carpet in the entrance of the room was stained and looked grubby  hotel location was great for me .Breakfast was great  ",1
6.7,We didnt choose the breakfast due to the price. We had no window and for some reason the room was cold.  Seemed to gave good space despite the unusual design of the room.Ensuite and hot water.  ,1
8.8,"Room a little small and strange layout  Very good location, staff friendly and efficient  ",1
7.1,Bedrooms were very small. Bathroom even smaller  Location was great and the rooms very clean  ,1
9.2,"The layout of Rooms x02 (x= floor) is not large enough for two people. The angles of walls make it difficult to get in/out of bed. But the staff let us move after the first night.  AirCon was not working when we were there but management was looking into the issue.  Location was perfect for us. 5 min walk to Centraal station and Access to Tram right out front door.  We did not pay for breakfast but instead went to s small family run mini market for coffee, yogurt & baked goods each morning.  ",1
7.5,"Room small Bathroom .. small and not private enough  ",1
8.8,"Great location , near train station and tram stop.  ",1
8.3,"Bathroom glass walls do not offer much privacy.  Room very small but I just use the room to sleep in, so for me not a big deal!!!  The hotel is centrally located and about a 10 minute walk from the train station.  The room is very small and furniture is angled strangely in room to fit.  The size of the room did not bother us but the bathroom enclosure, which is not behind walls but glass was a drawback.  You can see the other person's shadow while they are in there .  Not a deal breaker for us because the room itself has my most important feature, being clean.  Location is great close to trams etc and be forewarned very close to the red light district.  ",1
8.8,Double Room was small for two gusts  2 days nice stay  ,1
7.9,If you are tall you might have trouble sitting on the toilet since it was oddly positioned into a corner. the front rooms on the  lower floor can be noisy from street traffic.  They let us check in early which was a godsend. The staff was very friendly and helpful especially at breakfast. excellent location.  ,1

1.0,Think twice before you order this hotel! The hotel tell us not to come because the COVID 19 And not want to refund the money. After a lot of messages they still not want to refund We also try to contact booking and no responses  We are very disappointed from the hotel connection  We don't understand how hotel can tell us that we are not welcome in their hotel and not want to bring the money back.  Nothing  ,0

10.0,"Exceptional location, amazing friendly staff. From the onset of having one of the 2 rooms available at 10H rather than 15H, the staff were exceptionally helpful and informative, and after they asked why we were in Amsterdam and we said for one of our birthdays, on the evening of the birthday some cakes, wine, and balloons with a card were left in the appropriate room. Fantastic!  ",1

5.0,"I didnt like that my room #414 had visible mold in the shower area, In addition, the rooms were quite small for double occupancy. I was misinformed about the breakfast, as I was misled into believing it was complimentary for guests, then upon check out, I saw I was charged twenty plus Euros. I absolutely would not have eaten there for that price. It wasn't my intention to even dine in until I was invited inside.  I enjoyed the location. Centrally located for easy walking to all of the key spots in Central Amsterdam.  ",0

10.0,"I was sharing a room with a friend and the bathroom was glass frosted room, I was ok with this but did think it could be a bit awkward if you were sharing a room as part of a larger party of friends and wouldn’t have liked that in that instance.  It was in a fabulous location, walking distance of station and restaurants, bars, museums etc! The property had modern rooms and was really clean! Staff were extremely friendly too!  ",1
5.8,"Be aware there are 2 glass walls for the bathroom.  You loose a lot of privacy.  If you get up before your spouse and take a shower, the light and noise will wake them up!!  Also if you want your air conditioning to work, you have to call the front desk to turn it on.  They don't tell you this.  Your controls in the room don't turn it on!  ",1

6.5,"The door knob is too heavy and it is very hard to open the door. This is very dangerous in case of emergency.The shower wall is molded. The glass of the bathroom should be darker, and should not be able to see through the glass. It is not comfortable when staying with friends.  The hotel is very centralized and very close to the train station.  It is very safe with a key to get in to the hotel and to the elevator.Good coffee is provided in the room  ",1
