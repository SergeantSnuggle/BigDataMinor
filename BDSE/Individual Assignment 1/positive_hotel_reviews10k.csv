 I booked this hotel to celebrate my mum s birthday and booked 3 months in advance with a very small request i e a little surprise in the room on arrival and also i booked a twin room I made my request through booking com and i reconfirmed by reservation with the hotel 2 days before and they said everything was noted and would be accomadated for on arrival the staff were friendly and the hotel entrance was impressive but when i was talking to the checking staff i was then told that the little surprise for my mum would not be ready in the room when we arrived in the room it was lovley but unfortuntley it was not the room we had booked as this was a double bed and not a twin bed so i went back down to check in and they said they would get housing keeping to sort this out The maid who came didn t understand what to do and looked extremley exhausted and tired so i helped her to split the bed and make the bed up as twin beds as i felt quite sorry for her Also the bathroom there was a sliding door you had to move to go into the toilet and shower this was extremely heavy to move i did ask the maid how to move it and she demonstated at holding one end of the door and just push very difficult especially for my mum By now i couldn t be bothered to go back downstairs and complain as this was for my mum birthday The little suprise that should of been in the room was delivered later in the day while we were in the room so the surprise was not really as i planned it I would like to say the breakfast staff were excellent especially Jennifer who was so friendly and knowing it was my mum s birthday organised something with the chef for my mum this was so sweet of her great customer service excellent memeber of staff should be awarded a Reward and Recognition for her hard work and great customer service overall the hotel was lovley the pool and sauna was clean and the gym was well equipped with up to date equipment ,0,384,1
 To the management and especially all the staff at this hotel I couldn t say thank you enough I was planning a romantic surprise trip to Paris to propose to my OH The staff on reception especially Thomas and Julien went beyond their dutys to ensure our trip was special On arrival we only had to wait 10 minutes for our room to be ready even though we were 2 hours earlier than the stated 3pm check in Check in was quick and without any problems and soon we were unpacked and ready for our few special days even if my heart was about to burst out of my chest with nerves for the proposal that evening On our way out Thomas and Julien pointed us in the right direction for all the main sights champs ET Arc De T Louve and also for gluten free resturants as my OH had special dietary requirements I proposed that evening after an amazing nightime cruise on the Seine and managed to photograph the proposal thanks again to the help of the staff at the hotel As a photographer I set up all my equipment to take a romantic couple shot something I always do on trips away with the Eiffel Tower in the background To the staff member on duty the night of the 23rd of April at 11 40pm I didnt get your name too nervous but thank you so much for your help Another example of helpful and friendly staff to make our trip memorable The next morning we were upgraded to room 615 and the view was absolutely stunning Our own personal view of the ET I will attach the photos The rooms were spotless and cosy We got a deluxe room and would highly recommend them The bathrooms were clean and while the rooms arent massive they were perfect for us so don t let that bother you We only got the breakfast once over our 3 days It wasnt included in the room price so we paid 30 each I have to say it is worth the price and the service was second to none We got cereal an omlette a fry fresh yoghurts fruits and breads juices teas and anything we wanted ,0,378,1
 LOCATION perfect STAFF we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the Park Plaza Building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel It wasn t The staff at the Park Plaza Westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming Their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the Park Plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back They were all smiley and happy to assist us On the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright The lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready It was a quick 10min wait which was fine No greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the Spectrum Bar It was 1500H and the bar was definitely not busy The difference between our experience between the staff from both Park Plaza Hotels was just really evident that I had to put it here ROOM SUPERIOR Room We stayed for our anniversary We got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels We were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night The TV monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc The bedroom and bath were just the right size It was not small but not too big as well We didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right Mini bar was stocked with the basics We liked that there were extra pillows for us to use Bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean BREAKFAST good old continental and english breakfast ,0,373,1
 These days when I go to London I want to stay in Hackney as my daughter lives there with her boyfriend And this place is virtually just a minute s walk away from her place You can either enter through the pub or through the hotel entrance at the back Fairly informal and relaxed atmosphere which is something I personally really like The Old Ship Inn is just around the corner from Hackney Empire and on Mare Street or around the back from Sylvester Path This time around I arrived really late but there was no problem whatsoever for my daughter to pick up the key for me Great service Stairs were a bit narrow and winding but hey It s the back of a pub and the rooms are on top of that very pub I like it Gives it a quaint and personal feel Only thing was that I didn t quite know how to get out in the morning but there was a button just slightly beside the door that I didn t see Not right AT the door but near it Anyway This was no biggie and I got out from the staircase and into the pub for breakfast I had a full English breakfast and it was simply to die for No black pudding but still extremely good Really good The girl at the counter had some problems understanding English but she did her best and seemed friendly The room was towards the back of the house where there s a rather narrow street which means people residing on the other side of it are able to look into your room should they choose to and vice versa of course I didn t think this was a problem at all as the window was frosted but if you want more privacy Creaky floors but to me again it gives it that quaint and personal feeling Also shows that it has history Once I was awake I could hear the creaking of the hallway as people passed but it really wasn t anything that disturbed me There are far more disturbing noises all around London traffic police cars lorries screaming druggies and drunkards and what have you ,0,373,1
 The entrance to the hotel is strange as you enter via a typical private apartment entrance Enter the lift to the 8th floor and then you are in the hotel in every sense of the word The very professional and welcoming reception staff welcome you and explain everything to be honest they could not have been more helpful Explaining the City and also about a 48 hour unlimited tram access card for 12 5 euros available to buy from reception very good value and made getting around the city very easy and cheap The furniture and style of the hotel is stunning great attention to detail nice clean lines and the room was beautifully presented and had everything you could want or wish for Not the largest of rooms but not small Very clean and large comfy bed we had a problem with fusing the lights and it was attended to immediately and someone came up from reception to make sure we were ok The breakfast was good nicely laid out and they would cook eggs omelet etc for you on demand and with anything you wanted to go with it Its a long time since I have been to a hotel where everything was so clean and welcoming I was unsure if the hotel was too far out of the City when booking but because we were driving and the hotel have parking close by at 5 euros per day rather than 60 80 per day in the center I decided to try There is a tram stop outside the hotel and armed with our cards we hopped on and off the trams during our two day stay never having a problem finding out where we wanted to go The 14 min tram ride into the city was easy quick clean and efficient On Saturday night we were later that 12 30 when the trams stop running and it was 25 euros for four of us to get back to the hotel The savings on the parking more than made up for that I would recommend this hotel to anyone in fact I am booking the hotel for myself and four friends in July which is the highest recommendation ,0,372,1
 Everything From the moment we stepped into the hotel to the minute we left we loved every moment Me and my wife love luxury and this was a treat for her birthday We live reasonably close to London for a start so neither of us fancied going out so we stayed in the hotel The staff were amazing and friendly They couldn t do enough for us We ordered from the in room dining menu which was extraordinary We both had the burger on the menu and was astounded when i was asked how did i want the burger cooked Around 30 minutes later the food arrived and was pushed into the room by one of the hotel staff The trolley the food was served in folded out as a table to we were able to sit around this to eat whilst enjoying the London Skyline The food was amazing I have never eaten something so delicious in all of my life I don t think i could have eaten any more than a main and a desert as it was so filling The rest of the evening was spent using the binoculars supplied by the hotel to gaze at the London Skyline From our room you could see the Southbank with the London Eye staring back We could see Big Ben illuminated in the back ground St Paul s Cathedral was right across the river from us and we had a fantastic view of London Bridge After a luxurious nights sleep in the biggest most comfortable bed we ve ever slept in we looked out over the morning London skyline which was somewhat more dismal and grey than the night before but being in The Shard made the weather irrelevant We went to breakfast which was included in our stay We were greeted at the entrance to the restaurant and shown to a table The chairs around the table were actual armchairs We were asked to get our food from the buffet which was the usual egg bacon sausage hash brown etc The food again was amazing We returned to the room to pack our things Everything had been amazing and was even better than we had imagined ,0,371,1
 This hotel is just fabulous We a group of six females stayed 27 to 29 January when the hotel reopened as Pillows Anna formerly Santon Hotel de Filasoof The decoration of the hotel is exquisite and makes you feel at home I highly recommend for solo travellers couples and small groups Upon our arrival we was greeted by the staff who welcomed us and sat us by the fireplace This was so cosy and warming given the very cold weather We stayed in the luxury double small rooms Each room is slightly different given the shape of each room however each room is as nice as the other My room 103 faced the front of the building which gave views of the street and the beautiful buildings opposite We also had a balcony which added another special touch The large double bed was very comfortable and allows for a good nights sleep The shower was also great with a good amount of water pressure The hotel is a 13 minute walk to Leidseplein or the number 1 tram can be used There is local supermarket nearby as well as coffee shops for breakfast We had breakfast at the hotel during our stay for the two mornings and this was delicious The staff are very attentive and willing to go the extra mile to please you I had yoghurt and granola scrambled eggs and toast Other options are available including smoked salmon local cheeses pastries and fruit to name a few The selection is good and it is nice that the kitchen is open for the visitors to see which also makes you feel as if you are at home rather then in a hotel The dining area has views of the garden and the neighbour s gardens This was extra special as two horses can be seen which is unusual to see in a city The hotel has a traditional spiral staircase which can be used however there is also a lift so would be ideal for any visitor with any mobility difficulties This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at and will be staying at again when I return for a future visit ,0,369,1
 From start The hotel accommodated my requests via email before our holiday The hotel itself is two minutes walk away from Sants station but don t be put off from this we heard no noise from our room On arrival we were an hour and a half early not expecting our room to be ready I wanted to ask if we could leave our bags at reception for safe keeping to which I was told we could check in as our room was ready The lady that dealt with us at reception was lovely very friendly and welcoming as were all staff that we met The room that we were allocated was on the 9th floor as i requested to be close to the roof top pool The balcony offered fantastic reviews and the room had everything we needed If I was picky I could say that tea coffee facilities would have been nice and an updated TV too but we weren t on holiday to stay in the room We didn t use the bar or restaurant we only used the pool on one occasion and we weren t disappointed It was quite busy around 5pm but the rooftop area was big enough to offer you your own space without feeling crowded The life guard on duty offered us serveral towels and was a pleasant chap My two sons loved the pool The pool itself is quite small but at one point I counted around 10 people enjoying it without it feeling like sardines On returning from our adventures each evening we returned to a cleaned room with fresh linen on every day and fresh towels and it just felt nice credit to the cleaning staff As i said before we didn t use the restaurant for breakfast or dinner We went to some local eateries all within a couple of minutes walk I would recommend El Pati for dinner the tuna steak and paella is out of this world and around 8 each which was a steal El Pati is opposite the hotel and there is a little pastry sandwich shop around the corner from the hotel two pastries for 1 and they were devine ,0,369,1
 This is our second time at the Montcalm Our first stay was in January 25th 26th for our birthdays and we was delighted by the hospitality of the staff from the door man to the guest experience agent krystine who went the extra mile in terms of our overall stay On arrival we was greeted promptly with door service complimentary glasses of presseco as we checked in and help with our bags to our room Overall we enjoyed our time in the MCRL hotel and the only let down was very minor being the underfloor heating in our bathroom but we was assured that all will be amended by the next time we come back Our second stay was 2 nights spend over this easter April 16th 18th and again the staff was completely professional and helpful The stay was again great but we had some concerns on the day of checking out My partner had been bitten by what could be a bed or dust parasite on her calf and lower left ankle We took pictures of the inflammation of the bites and will be contacting the hotel to prevent any further such happenings A slight downer to our break We was also slightly confused as to why the admittance to the sauna facility now closed half an hour early then on our previous stay but we was happy to see the changing room was both running in accordance to this hotels standard As for the staff present during our stay we would definitely like to thank Ivet the guest experience agent who provided assistance from even before we arrived in terms of any special requests we may of needed Daniel who was also very helpful He handled our bags with care as he took them from reception to room and even then went the extra mile to provide additional help by going to the aviary to bring my fianc and I the dining menu explaining how great the food and ambience was Also we would like to thank Johnny and Clairease who work as waiter and waitress in the avairy for such pleasant hospitality and would definitely be coming back very soon ,0,366,1
 The place is by far the best Traveling to Paris for a 3 night stay over New Years Our experience started with a kind email from the hotel Benoit offering to arrange a limo service to collect us from the airport We availed of this facility with was prompt and friendly and got us to our hotel in superior comfort On our arrival we were met by with a fantastic and warm welcome which set the tone for and exceptional stay Our room was not ready as we were early but they kindly kept our bags and explored the city I did ask for them not to rush the room I m happier for it to be cleaned correctly I m a bit of a stickler on cleanliness in hotels When we returned we were brought to the room and our bags had been brought up there was music playing on the rooms iPad We were presented with complementary gateaux s from the Thouimeux Bakery In addition we were advised of the Dring me service Which is a free phone with Dring me installed providing free international calls so we could ring home on new years The phone could also be brought out with you anywhere in Paris It had maps app not google so we could locate the places we wanted to see and it provided up to date transport options buses taxi metro and walking This information was live so when public transport was free on New Years Eve it told us first We brought it everywhere and were able to make our early new years calls home with out the worry of roaming charges or the worry of getting lost The rooms are as good as they are advertised in every element From the luxurious duvet and pillows to the marble floors and porcelain sinks funky mirrors slippers and dressing gowns provided The air conditioning for me as with all hotel rooms was slightly noisy at night noting that this was the normal operational sounds for this system the engineer in me but this can be turned off from the controller in your room if your a light sleeper ,0,364,1
 I was really looking forward to staying here as its a mythical name in hotels and the beautiful facade clearly demonstrates its period splendour First impression when you walk in it s a bit ordinary and sort of like almost any Hilton anywhere There are many gorgeous period details like the palm court the iron work the wonderful old doors and old the marble staircase But you don t notice those straight away it felt a little soulless and ordinary and I think the entrance and initial public rooms could have been made to be much more elegant and in period That said I found our room very comfortable all the corridors are well decorated and clean not exactly my taste but overall very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely even if the bath tub was a little small and no overly comfortable to shower in No wifi in rooms you have to pay which is just plain mean for a hotel of this cost The health centre was a disappointment It s actually a gym open to membership to anyone and that wasn t clear to me Consequently it felt like any gym anywhere else Facilities were fine and the pool room was nice One of the reasons I chose the Waldorf was for the pool as I wanted a relaxing afternoon by the pool reading Sadly that was not possible given how extremely noisy it was with children and families playing The management need to police how the pool functions for everyone s benefit It also closes at 5 on a Sunday and given check in is at 3 I was very disappointed the concierge hadn t mentioned this when we booked Breakfast we had to wait in a short queue to be seated Overall the breakfast was good and plentiful but I don t think the cooked breakfast was excellent When we left at 8 45 the queue was very long so make sure you go early This dining room is not rally big enough for the number of rooms in the hotel and if a lot of people turn up the queue is long ,0,360,1
 The location is wonderful as it is close to restaurants a large grocery store metro stops hop on hop off bus stops the aerobus stop to the airport and the bus stop for some day tours outside Barcelona Perfect base for sightseeing within Barcelona as it is at the top of Las Ramblas and close to the Gothic Quarter Nice bright large clean rooms My husband now wants us to install a similar rain shower head in our shower Excellent internet connectivity We opted for twin beds and they were comfortable We stayed here twice over a period of three weeks once for four nights and another for one night before and after a cruise We informed them that we would be arriving early on both visits I expected that we would need to leave our luggage but we were pleasantly surprised when they let us check in to our rooms upon arrival both times at no additional cost We had a little inconvenience with workmen doing work outside our room at 8 a m Normally not a problem since we are usually up and out early Hotel staff responded to our concerns immediately Reception staff was not aware that work was to be done on our floor that morning and they said that work is usually done later in the day to avoid any disruptions for guests Staff went over and above in ensuring that the rest of our stay was wonderful Can t say enough about the staff All employees that we saw and dealt with from reception to doorman to restaurant staff were very pleasant friendly and very helpful The one minor drawback to the room is that we wish there more electrical outlets Also the placement of the existing outlets could have been better There were two outlets in the bathroom and one at the desk available for use We unplugged a lamp to use an outlet by a bed We travel with two phones two tablets two fitbits two cameras and one curling iron which makes charging items a challenge Next time we are in Barcelona this is were we will stay ,0,359,1
 Staff s attitude to provide good services from reception counter to concierge or the maids On 6 May I went to check into the hotel as a 2nd call of my stay 1st call was 4 5 May and I was told that there were double booking with booking com I didn t realize that and asked the reception staff to cancel one for me Michael contacted his colleague in other department and told me I had to contact Booking com directly since the booking was made there Before I could call Booking com the guy at the concierge his name is difficult to pronounce proposed to take care of my luggage and gave me a glass of water and told me that everything would be attended and fine This is very good service to comfort your guest He moved me to the business centre room next door where I was able to make a phone call to Booking com I informed booking com over phone of my situation and how I by mistake made my own booking twice Staff verified the situation and got back to me with email confirming that one of the booking was cancelled without charges This took only 5 10 minutes of the handling and I was happy with their efficient action Later I was able to check in and even got upgrade to the Club room After I got into my room Michale made a follow up call to see if everything went ok in my room How impressive In the evening on the day of my check out 7 May I was dragging my luggage by myself I didn t call staff since it s just on the same floor But then there were few steps of stairs to make and the maid who saw me dragging my big luggage came to help pushing my bag I was surprised to see how staff was attentive to assist their guest Over all I surely will recommend this hotel to the others and I will come back to stay there in the future ,0,350,1
 I was super happy and grateful to find through Booking com this GEM of hotel which provided on site parking It s in such a great location two blocks from the high Street of Wimbledon with an abundance of shops restaurants and pubs and then just down a bit is the train station to get into London I had a single room with ensuite and it was all sparkling clean and cosy Small and compact but plenty of room to move have cases out etc double wardrobe desk side table plenty of breeze from the double window if you wanted it As with a lot of small hotels there s no aircon there is heating which is more necessary in the UK however there is a fan if it gets a little warm Shower was great with good pressure and plenty of hot water you need to run the tap a while before it comes through The hotel wasn t full when I was there so I found it very quiet and I love quiet The staff from my first interaction were so lovely and helpful Everyone I saw on the reception desk as I passed in and out each day said hello and a chat which I enjoyed You do have to get your cases up the stairs so know that or ask for a ground floor room What a bonus is the beautiful cafe attached now to the hotel The staff and food all fabulous and healthy and there is outside seating under trees also Good coffee a rarity in the UK and they have almond milk Inside the cafe is gorgeous as well Fresh cold pressed juices and smoothies Wonderful healthy salads and raw food desserts What a gem to find this I could not fault the hotel or anything about it I loved it and will definitely recommend to everyone and will go back when I next visit London They are also sending me my chargers because like a dill I left them in the wall sockets sorry I had a lovely three nights ,0,350,1
 Review of Ramada Apollo Hotel in Amsterdam My husband and I recently spent four very pleasant nights at the Ramada Apollo hotel in Amsterdam While the hotel s location was not in the city core it was easily reached in 16 minutes on the 13 tram from Centraal train station With Amsterdam s amazing system of trams there was no site within the city core that we couldn t reach from our hotel within about 30 minutes or so thus making it convenient but less expensive than a closer location might be When we asked for a room with a view on a high floor at the registration desk we were instantly upgraded to such a room a step up from the standard smaller room we had booked We enjoyed our room very much as well as the amenities delivered daily tea and coffee The room was modern attractive and comfortable and it met all of our needs and expectations The hotel was located in a safe neighbourhood within a park setting and was a mere one minute walk from where the tram deposited us Even though we arrived back at the hotel quite late each night we always felt safe especially as there were usually other hotel guests alighting from the tram with us plus other passersby on the street I think what we liked best about the hotel however was the friendly very helpful and enthusiastic staff we encountered at the reception desk We probably dealt with about four or five different staff during our stay and each one was extremely attentive knowledgeable and service oriented Any questions we asked were met with instant smiles internet research maps circled with our destinations etc A note left behind for maintenance staff advised we were out of body wash in the shower resulted in a timely refill and a handful of those little sample bottles We also availed ourselves of the hotel s airport shuttle service which cost a modest 5 euros apiece and whisked us off to Schiphol airport on time and within 15 minutes of departure ,0,350,1
 First of all I have to say that amazing people are working at this hotel Marie Helen Laure Nordine and Mazier It is impossible to accept them just as staff These people are great people warm and attentive With lovely sense of humor Making you to feel that you are surrounded with close and really caring friends That s simply their nature The hotel itself is nicely designed I was staying on the 6th floor The room was functional and clean with very comfortable bed It was a bit small I mean the room but you don t waste time in the hotel room when you are in Paris The location of the hotel is perfect in between two metro stations Luxembourg and Saint Michel next to Sorbone and a few steps from Pantheon There is a bus station about 100 m from the hotel Although in the middle of the city it was quite and peaceful The fountains on the plateau in front of the hotel were creating a specific atmosphere When in the room the feeling was like you are out of the city near some river or waterfall Very relaxing There was an espresso making machine in the room with both regular and decaf coffee capsules and with a selection of tea Breakfast was good Nothing spectacular just good Some standard ham and salami couple of traditional French cheese home made jam selection scrambled eggs with sausage croissant If you are staying in a hotel for more than one night a bit fantasy while creating the breakfast menu would be highly appreciated But again everything was very fresh nice and positive If your breakfast is not included in the room price you can have your morning coffee with fresh croissant for 2 2 euro just on the other side of the street Also there are some restaurants and a Marks and Spencer express shop nearby in case of an emergency All in all it was really a positive experience Definitely recommended hotel for your Paris stay ,0,341,1
 Upon check in the staff were all so polite and welcoming to stepping through the doors We were served by Shady who really polite and friendly and let us know about the other amazing little perks about staying here to the love music on the evening and spa treatments also Always had bad experiences with hotels just but staying here has just been above and beyond anything we stayed the 1 night and I ve never been amazed as soon as I walked into our hotel room as I did here The room was spotless and bathroom was fantastic with a separate shower and a superb bath which I loved Everything is so easy to get too and within walking distance from either Embankment or Waterloo station couldn t fault anything Celebrating my boyfriends birthday before he is deployed for a while this was our last little trip together till next year and arriving back in our hotel there was a lovely little note and an AMAZING CHEESECAKE left for us reading Happy Birthday and to enjoy our stay from Celeste Sullivan Guest relations manager I was certainly not expecting anything so kind and for that I m beyond grateful Breakfast in the morning was just brilliant the staff were soo efficient and quick and still so friendly the choice of food was brilliant even for the picky eaters like my self and winner of Peanut Butter Checking out was a breeze and we were then served by the lovely Nicole who made sure our stay went well and was really friendly the kind of service you expect to get from any hotels you tend to stay at and I will never stay anywhere other than here in the future Thank you Park Plaza for the most amazing experience here at your wonderful hotel me and my partner were amazed by your service and can t wait to come back again next year HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and family friendly too you won t be disappointed x X x ,0,339,1
 From the perspective of location this hotel is perfect Just off the Champs de Elyse and a short walk to the Metro George V you have ease of access to the city and all the must sees From the moment of arrival this quintessential Parisian boutique hotel was everything one would wish for expect and be pleasantly surprised From all staff knowing our names and engaging us in respect of where we lived the doorman was interested in talking about our local football team to the wonderful attention to detail from roses petals on the bed and a daily rose this establishment ticks all the boxes Upon entry into the foyer you are immediately aware you are somewhere special and each and every experience from there does not disappoint The hotel bar is simply elegant and a beautiful escape from the ever busy city streets Our room was just divine An elegant balance of Parisian history in what obviously is a 19th century building with modern conveniences The bed was extraordinarily comfortable the bathroom large for a city hotel and the space in the apartment itself ensured we were not falling over each other The antique period furniture provided a beautiful ambience The touch of handing your room key every time you leave to reception is a touch from a bygone era and its value is realised when they hand it to you as you walk through reception knowing who you are and your room number without you asking with the warmest of greetings and query as to whether they can do anything extra for you Location to restaurants and caf s both on the Champs de Elyse and Rue de Berri provides great choice You will be left with lasting memories and a feeling of loss when you leave This truly was one of those hotels that added to the experience of Paris in the most positive of ways and we cannot recommend this establishment without a higher regard ,0,332,1
 Truly lovely boutique hotel in a wonderful location with fantastic staff I would heartily recommend staying here if you re a person who is looking for a nicer small hotel It is appropriately priced for sure If I had to think of a population for which it is not suited I perhaps would not recommend it for a young family or at least not a family with more than one child nor to a person who prefers to stay at much larger chain hotels meaning they expect certain standard amenities presented in a certain standard way that s not a bad thing but it s important to know what you want My husband and I are people who like to travel want to enjoy a location s unique surroundings and vastly prefer a well appointed luxurious but not over the top boutique hotel or inn If that s also you I say don t hesitate to book Some points to note Rooms are small sure but the size is precisely what one would or should expect from a hotel in Paris or almost any large city Particularly at this price point Beds are firm but very comfortable and well outfitted Bathroom size is quite generous in my opinion especially for Paris Breakfast is available for purchase though I can t comment on it as we always went out Complimentary tea time coffee tea snack is offered every afternoon 4 00 6 00 Ice water with lemon or mint and fresh apples are available all day There is a computer and printer available for your use at all hours located just off the larger of two sitting rooms connected to the lobby The complimentary wifi is very good and reliable throughout the building Staff is present and ready to help at the front desk at all hours rarely only one person often more than two ,0,316,1
 Everything This recently renovated hotel is classy clean and very comfortable From the warm welcome at reception after we parked our car in their secure underground car park to the moment we checked out and drove away everything was perfect The staff were professional helpful and friendly at all times The breakfasts were superb with every possible combination of hot cold food and drinks available and were available until 11 00 am The room we booked was a Superior Double which was around 20 sq meters in size and very well appointed and quite classy with one of the largest and most comfortable beds we ever slept in There was a well stocked mini bar with complimentary Still and Sparkling water which was replenished daily There was also tea and coffee making facilities in the room and we had a lovely complimentary bottle of Cava in our room on arrival The room overlooked the rear of the hotel and through the rather grand double opening windows we looked down on the superb modern pool and lounge area which was very quiet and peaceful The WiFi is free and there is excellent coverage and a strong signal throughout the hotel including the bedroom and all public areas And you don t have to constantly re log on every time you come and go in the hotel it was seamless The location was great too as the hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the main square in Barca Placa de Catalunya and just a couple of minutes on from there to La Rambla The Gothic Quarter is around a ten mins walk away and 30 mins will take you to the Sagrada Familia unfinished Cathedral of Gaudi A really lovely hotel which we would stay at again in a heartbeat Great service great rooms and decor and absolutely great value for money Gracias ,0,316,1
 My daughter 18 and I stayed here for 4 nights and though the room was smaller than anticipated despite being an Executive room and them not fulfilling our wish for a corner room it was at the end of the hallway room 402 and therefore very quiet Floor carpeting though somewhat old fashioned certainly helps keep the noise level down The AC is very efficient and runs very quietly so our nightly sleep was wonderful The beds are on the softer side which is to our liking so that was good We checked in and our room fridge was not working after 2 different attempts over 1 5 days the fridge was replaced We asked for an iron and board and this was delivered immediately and left with us for the whole trip which was great The breakfast room while small is good and the breakfast very extensive especially for Spanish standards Our bathroom was renovated and modern but not 100 clean hair in the tub on the first day afterwards not a problem anymore though and everything was replaced daily as needed towels paper etc Rooftop terrace is lovely but as it s small and narrow it gets very crowded very quickly and unfortunately non hotel guests are allowed there too so there isn t room for paying guests pity The staff everywhere is very helpful and friendly The location is perfect for walking to the Gothic Quarter El Born La Rambla etc where there are tons of bars restaurants and eclectic shops and beaches harbor but a bit of a schlepp to the Metro The bus stop and the hop on hop off bus is right outside the door if you choose that traveling method All in all a clean modern hotel on the inside in a beautiful old style Spanish building with friendly staff and good breakfast Would definitely come back ,0,316,1

 Great accessible location We took the A2 airport to central La Catalunya bus as we landed in Terminal 2 The bus journey is a non stop service and takes roughly 30 minutes We paid 6 for a single ticket as we were unsure of how we would travel back to the airport at the time The hotel is a 15 minute walk from central La Catalunya La Ramblas is a 10 minute walk away so really ideal You re away from all the noise yet close enough to walk there The hotel Amazing hotel with unique decor Really comfortable rooms providing the necessities such as towels shower gel shampoo conditioner a shower cap and a shaving kit Great for those staying for a short time with only hand luggage Great views from our hotel room as well as from the 360 hotel rooftop bar Easy to access using the hotel lift and just phenomenal views They have a bar which is reasonably priced Definitely worth it to view a sunset The pool is quite small which is why I scored it in the middle We didn t check the pool size and not sure if the dimensions are on their website but we were prepared with our swimming gear in case however they didn t come to use The hotel breakfast This was complimentary in our price and the breakfast was delicious Great coffee machine with teas available too Good selection of fruits breads juices cakes as well as sausages scrambled eggs mushrooms tomatoes and bacon They even have a toastie so you can make your own grilled sandwiches with sliced meats and cheese provided P S We were handled by Irene at reception who was really helpful She gave us the advice we required as well as handy tips and recommendations Thank you Irene ,0,307,1
 Nice friendly staff Staff at reception Recommended a nice sea food restaurant along the Marina and what a great choice indeed The best sea food place we have eaten so far hands down We thoroughly enjoyed it and the food was just amazing Sorry I lost the business card and I can t remember the restaurant s name It was a positive experience from an otherwise unpleasant start of the evening for on our way to the marina we had an unpleasant experience with the taxi driver who drove us there The drive was plain rude and very aggressive At one point he and another driver were arguing with each other bec Our diver had cut him off We felt uncomfortable and was getting scared We wanted to get off from the cab Luckily we reached the marina in one piece without getting into an accident Not only was the driver rude and unfriendly he also overcharged us for the fare by pressing the meter more than once so we ended up paying 5 6 euros more than we should When we got back to the hotel we reported the incident at the front desk since they were the ones who called the taxi for us Christian Fernandez the hotel s concierge called the Taxi company and relayed our bad experience with the supervisor The next morning Christian informed us that the taxi company supervisor reimbursed our fare and apologized for the driver s erratic driving and rudeness What a big surprise I did not expect to be refunded for the fare but we were very appreciative This is what I call great service and being attentive to the guest needs I would recommend this hotel to anyone I will not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if and when I return to Barcelona ,0,307,1
 The hotel is perfectly situated in the center of Paris a walking distance from the Louvre the Notre Dame Centre Pompidou Hotel de Ville and literally above the Chatelet Metro RER central station where most of the lines cross The hotel is clean and organized and the staff was very helpful and polite with any request We were traveling with both of our kids ages 8 and 5 and stayed in the executive family room The room has a double bed a nd a couple of twin beds and was spacious enough for all 4 of us The room offers a buffet breakfast which we took only on our 1st day The cost was 24 euro per person and children don t pay the buffet is rich with a variety of foods to choose from fruit cheese sausages eggs cereals and so on Nevertheless on the next days we had breakfast at different bistros which are right at the doorstep of the hotel and cost roughly half the price In addition right across the street from the entrance there s a branch of the Boulangerie Parisienne where you can by fresh Croisants and sandwiches and take them for the road The area where the hotel is located Le Marais is one of the nicest and coolest areas in Paris full of restaurants bistros and shops in a pedestrian mall so it is really nice to walk around the streets in this area and enjoy the atmosphere Transportation wise this hotel has the perfect location with the Chatelet Metro RER station located at the hotels doorstep literally this is a very central station with almost all lines passing there Especially RER lines A B which are used for airport transportation and Disneyland Paris I would definitely go back to this hotel on my next trip ,0,306,1
 The staff were welcoming on arrival and the lounge area was comfortable and there were stands with information about the various attractions in the City The room was huge and one side of it was a wall of windows looking out to the top of the Rijksmuseum straight ahead and down on the garden with glass pyramids which were lit up at night We would recommend the higher floors for the best views we were on the 6th The room was spacious and the bed large and very comfortable The bathroom had a full sized bath with a shower attached The TV was large and there was the usual tea coffee making facilities as well as a small fridge mini bar There was plenty of space in the wardrobes cupboards and there was an iron and ironing board not that we used it but it was a thoughtful addition to the facilities There was a fitness suite downstairs and ice making facilities down the corridor The Reception staff were cheerful friendly and very helpful even going online to book our return seats on the plane for us the day before we left Fortunately their English was very good as neither of us spoke any Dutch We found a number of restaurants locally over the other side of the canal and the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum were both within a very short walk from the hotel in the other direction There were busses and trams not far away and apparently the bus usually stops even closer but there are some works going on to build a carpark under the canal so the bus stops a bit further away at the moment The works didn t disturb us at all We would definitely return to the nh Museum Quarter again ,0,301,1
 I honestly never write reviews for the places I stay in but my stay with Atrium Palace was so perfect my friends and I were adamant we had to write a review The hotel staff were amazing and extremely helpful We were only in Barcelona for the weekend so we asked them for places to eat and where to go Moises helped us find our way around The location was perfect it was on a quieter street to la ramblas but everything was within walking distance It was probably a 10 minute walk to the aerobus which takes you straight to the airport All attractions are close by from sagrada familia to local parks the only place you will probably have to travel a little extra for is park Guell I could not recommend this hotel enough the extra touches in the room walking us out to the taxi under an umbrella to 24 hour room service ordered pizza 6 in the morning Also on the Sunday our flight was in the evening so we wanted to leave our suitcases at the hotel this was the first time a hotel asked us if we wished to leave our luggage During my stay I used the massage room which again I would highly recommend as it s worth the euros on the last day we did make use of the pool and also the sauna which is incredibly relaxing before a flight The hotel itself is beautiful our room had a balcony and looked out on to street which during sunset looks stunning We didn t take advantage of breakfast but we were recommended Alsur Cafe which I will be returning to as the food is delicious We will definitely be staying here again when we return to Barcelona ,0,300,1
 Loved the location as I like being near the action but not directly in the heart of it This area felt more like a neighborhood and offered all of the ease that comes w it grocery 1 2 block away local cafes bakeries restaurants etc Quick 2 3 min walk to the Underground Metro station of U 2 and U 3 and trams as well Very walkable to city center about 10 min walk to Opera House 5 min to Hofburg Palace and the museums Felt very safe and as a single female traveler I put that as a high priority I felt safe throughout Vienna easy city to visit get around Would stay in this area again Liked that the hotel offered coffee tea hot choc service for free from the hours of 12 00 noon to midnight I did not pay for the breakfast Found it easier and cheaper to pick up some items at the grocery store bakeries room had a refrigerator and I used that to hold some items I always travel w ear plugs and feel like you might need them due to early morning trash trucks on the back streets and noise from other room guests nearby that might be loud As it was unusually mild temps during my stay I actually opened the window to get fresh air into the room almost each day I liked having that option Very clean room Just so you know the lobby area comes across very modern but my room seemed to be in an older section that did not match the lobby pictures you see but the room was still just fine Plenty of hot water clean safe great location public transportation access refrigerator etc which is what really matters to me ,0,298,1
 The wifi was appallingly slow in the room and non existent on the roof top bar The bathroom in our Superior room was tiny and very poorly designed with few toiletries one shampoo that doubled as shower gel no conditioner no bathrobes and the basin was in the corridor outside the bathroom so no possibility of any privacy and no space around it for two people s toiletries the shower was in the same tiny space as the loo so we swapped rooms with my daughter whose Standard room had a better bathroom but was a smaller size with a smaller bed For two people sharing the Superior room the bathroom is a joke not a funny one Breakfast was chaotic with the main coffee machine broken throughout our four night stay A tiny kettle provided to boil water for tea but it was the slowest you could ever imagine and also tiny so one was constantly looking for staff to ask for more water Not enough teapots ever large cups ran out no plain yoghurt on two days the most popular so there were always spare fruit ones that no one seemed to want choice of food was good though some cakes and pastries tasted of chemicals and were clearly not home made Very dry and tasteless Red Velvet cake Check out was problematic Summary brilliant location clean hotel nice staff but terrible bathrooms and chaos at breakfast Needs a shake up in management at breakfast which incidentally was NOT included in the price and charges hefty 9 Euros per person if booked for the duration of your stay at check in otherwise I think it was 15 Euros per person and a rethink about everything to do with the bathrooms which were just dismal ,0,298,1
 My boyfriend and I have just returned from Amsterdam I had surprised him with a trip for his birthday We had the most fabulous stay at Pillows hotel I couldn t fault one thing from start to finish From reception to bedrooms the hotel was clean and modern with a boutiquey feel throughout You could sleep for days in those beds and make snow angels in the thick plush carpets what comfort dreams are made of As for the staff I can t stress enough how fabulous they were friendly calm up for laugh and incredibly attentive they did everything to make our stay the most special it could be At the start we experienced a slight mix up with our room thought what we had booked had a terrace but this was quickly resolved by the fantastic staff who showed us to a different room equally as fabulous that was better suited to our requirements if of interest swapped to basement room it had doors that led to an outdoor patio Since it was a celebratory trip I had asked the hotel to decorate the room with balloons etc for when we arrived back to the hotel after a day in town Normally a hotel would just put a bottle of champagne on ice but on hearing my boyfriend has more of a sweet tooth than love for alcohol the hotel manager kindly went out herself to source a selection of sweets and chocolates to sprinkle around the room with balloons and a birthday banner What a woman All in all I can t recommend this place enough I will most definitely be returning there on my next trip to Amsterdam and can only hope that they expand to more cities around the world ,0,297,1
 We stayed in this hotel for one week during Christmas The hotel is not exactly in the centre of milan and there are like two train changes to arrive near the duomo but for the price we paid it was quite a nice hotel and the metro is only 3 mins away In the room we had a nice shower tea coffee making facilities that were given for free when we asked i also forgot my toothbrush and they gave me a new one immediatly Also one day we had to catch a train early in the morning and since we had to skip breakfast they prepared for us a small breakfast to take on the trip with us In summery all our requests were always met so thumbs up to the staff Few mins away from the hotel there is a hairdresser and also a very very big supermarket were you can buy almost anything Across the street there is also an amazing restaurant which specialaize in fish called Arrow s which is worth a try Almost all the staff was helpful and friendly except one of the breakfast womans with black hair and glasses who was always so pissed off unfortunatley The breakfast had a large variaty of sweets a bit less choice of food The scrambled egg was something we didnt like so much as it had a funny sweet taste Also if you want to have a drink at the bar they offer also free nibbles after 5pm which we thought was a nice gesture I did not give 5 star only because the location is far away from the centre otherwise the hotel is very value for money Thankyou for making our holiday a little more perfect ,0,294,1
 Everything was very very excellent In particular all the staff The check in smooth and easy arriving early letting us leave our bags at the hotel before the room was ready thereafter the bags in the room waiting for us I do not like using credit cards so Agne and Barbara at Reception went out of their way to help me arrange around that via a telephone call late the night before Nothing was too much trouble We also decided to stay on an extra week yes it is that good and friendly and everyone made it very easy to change rooms and then remain in the new room rather than move again We had room service a couple of times and the food was excellent I would like tea and coffee facilities in the room but there is a Nespresso and selection of teas downstairs near reception so no bother The room s themselves are very well designed modern chic always very clean power shower our first room had a bath Speedy free wifi also and flatscreen tv Air con Very well designed room s The hotel itself is very modern warm and cosy a Chelsea Townhouse and you do feel are coming home each time This feeling is very difficult to create in a hotel but Sydney House manage this quite easily Overall this is a very very well managed boutique hotel and as you can expect it is the staff that make it work They genuinely care about the guests and they genuinely like their jobs This is very apparent at all times from reception to housekeeping to room service The high quality and friendliness of the staff are the key to the success of this hotel ,0,292,1
 Having travelled extensively around the world for business or vacation i can freely declare that this is the best hotel staff i ve ever met Me and my wife got sick in Vienna an intestinal virous was exterminating Vienna population during Christmas holiday time and for the three days it lasted we felt like being sick back home The front desk staff took care of the doctor we had what we asked for from the bar dinner etc and soon we were up and running again Apart from all these the light brown wooden furniture reminded us of staying in a chalet the warmth literally and the cleanliness of the room and the whole facility took our staying to another level The location on Uno was the best possible as it is just 10 minutes walk from the gigantic nearby mall and 3 minutes walk from the Metro station Billa market is just across the street providing whatever you like the room has a small fridge and you can keep things fresh in there For those loving Greek cuisine Nikos with his Argo restaurant are across the street also serving delicious Greek and Mediterranean food from 12 30 in the noon till late night Last but not least i was wandering around with a 5000 Euro camera lens combination on my shoulder and felt safer than 99 9 of the rest of the world i ve been to The neighborhood is as peaceful as a monastery well so is the whole of Vienna and there are lots to see around What else can i say i ve been in Vienna about a hundred times honestly but finally i ve found a new home there The Park Inn ,0,289,1
 Dear All My name is Pamela I live in Malta I come very regularly to Paris This was my first time at Helzear Suites I stayed 3nights I must say the note giving on booking is way to low compare the space comfort location and service I go every time to hotels when I stay in Paris 97 of hotels in Paris unless you go to 5stars you have the elevator close to the rooms and very small rooms Here you have a door that separate before going to your suites You have all comfort at Helzear If you don t feel like eating out you can cook because a kitchen with a good size fridge available and well equipped Everything Very clean you can order breakfast if you don t feel like going out the night before I personally like it The location is just Top You have on of the best market where you can buy almost everything Pharmacy close by a French bakery Josephine 2min from there that is really good a supermarket 5min Champs lys es 8min walk and very important you are not in a noisy place The staff was really amazing very helpful a special thank you to Maria at the reception I would compare Helzear suites with a proper Parisian boutique hotel because you just feel home If you want to feel how it is to live in Paris it s the place to be without you taking care of anything The staff is there when you need but not overdoing it I can only recommend I m definitely coming back Keep it up Helzear Suites I gave a note of 10 10 because nothing negative to say Pamela M,0,288,1
 We stayed for 2 nights in September before we boarded our river cruise We used Booking com and our room price was amazing I had booked it almost 1 year out knowing the dates I would be there so the early bird does get the worm I had checked many times but could never come close in price Staff was always wonderful we came in about 9am after an overnight flight and were so welcomed Our room was not ready but were offered a glass of cold fruit infused water by Peter who was so pleasant so sorry his Mom passed during our stay he waited while we removed a few things from our bags and put them away for safe keeping We returned early afternoon and our room was ready with a canal view The room was a bit warm and the requested fan arrived as the trip was a birthday celebration a lovely tray arrived with Champagne as we settled in I loved the location there are lots of little restaurants nearby to choose from Amsterdam is great walking city so nothing seemed far If one chose to take the train from the airport the train station is certainly not a bad walk We were meeting our cruise at the Hilton Doubletree and just walked over with our bags This hotel is an interesting building with history and character lovely stained glass Our room was large had a nice big bathroom with a tub if one chose a minibar that was stocked with wine beer soda peanuts each day a coffee maker I would certainly not hesitate to return We did not eat here so i cannot comment on the restaurant ,0,285,1
 The location is great It is not in the center but there is a very good metro connection which takes about 2 minutes to get you to the center This also allowed us to stay in a completely new modern and open minded hotel with great staff which is something I cannot say for hotels in the center of Amsterdam based on other booking suggestions The hotel is 3 metro stops from the Central Train Station and 1 metro stop or 10 min walk from the Amstel Train Station The Amstel Station is a better option if you are traveling from Eindhoven via train The hotel provides free access to a number of services including laundry gym and multiple games in the reception area High speed internet is free everywhere including the rooms The restaurant is very nice although it was not included in the price of our room We asked for breakfast on the last day for 12 euro person The breakfast was great lots of options and very friendly staff The restaurant also has great options for lunch and dinner The room was great it was clean modern spacious and very ingenious There were lots of small details that made our day everything was so welcoming The name of the hotel may be confusing but this is definitely not a student hostel The hotel is located next to a college so that would explain the name This is for sure a great experience If we ever go to Amsterdam again we will book again The hotel is cash free so every service that you need to pay for has to be done via card We had no issues with that ,0,284,1
 Super happy with everything My boyfriend has a birthday when we come to the hotel The staff made a special gift for him When we sat in the lobby for a little while and went out to see the city they came with a cake and champagne glasses for both This was SUPER SURPRISE for both me and my boyfriend He thought I organized all this but myself was so surprised i try to find quickly my phone to make a photo If I were to be prepared then I would take this special moment on camera or video because it s memory for life The room was ok little bit maybe expensive i was thinking but because of service in hotel how much attencion they have how special day was for us it was worth it And this day my boyfriend could use bar and all drinking from the bar and snacks for free Milan is expensive for example a beer in caf outside cathedral duomo cost 9 and fanta drink 6 A little bit Walk from center and its halv price for drinking and restaurang anyway i notice more nice and cheaper to have a drink and snacks at hotel big beer cost 8 50 inklusive snacks My conclusion about trip to Milan its very beautiul and worth to to visit be careful on the street If you stay in nice hotel like we did you will enjoy it Service at hotel was the best i ever had if i ever visit again Milan i will stay here at NH Collection Milano president Thank you so much for everything I will allways remember you and your hotel THANK YOU xxx,0,283,1
 I booked this as a last minute surprise for the final night of our stay on what felt like a very epic adventure around Europe It was myself and my partners Honeymoon and and we had been backpacking for a fortnight Nimes Toulouse Carcassonne and last but not least Barcelona so this was a real treat And oh my what a treat it was We arrived around 11am check in is 3pm in the centre of Le Gothic a beautiful part of Barcelona to very friendly staff who took are bags and handed us a glass of something sparkly while wishing us a very happy honeymoon We asked if we could wait by the pool until our room was ready to which there was no trouble at all We sipped on beautiful fruit cocktails on a stunning empty roof terrace with a stunning pool looking at the roof tops and blue sky of a stunning city that we love And relaxed like we never knew we could Our room was ready soon after that 12 30 We loved the old stone walls mixed with the modern sleek design and the amazingly large bed with beautiful rose petals scattered around it and with complementary everything everywhere Then a surprising knock at the door with desserts and champagne We really did feel so spoiled and fussed We had lunch at the Bistro and it was so stunning we ended up having dinner there too Breakfast was also a real treat After traveling for so long it was lovely to spend our last day in real luxury and bliss Thankyou so much and we will definitely be back again hopefully every anniversary ,0,281,1
 Step out of the hotel take a few steps towards Via Dante and you re immediately engulged by Milano s tourist crowd It s a great location especially if you re here to visit the Expo Milano 2015 Cairoli station is just a three minute walk away from the hotel and you re at the Expo in about 25 minutes for 2 50 You can find everything you need around the hotel And if you re the kind that likes to shop there s plenty to keep you occupied The hotel values form over function so if you re traveling for business and need a desk or table to place your laptop to work from well chances are you might not get that At least not in the single room I booked a quiet room and even though I didn t hear any of the hustle and bustle from the hallway and stairs the room i got faced two small side streets and that was fairly busy so make sure you close the windows for some peace and quiet Breakfast at the hotel is a basic affair true to its general theme You can get bread cheese croissants and meat but you ll have to order the eggs seperately if you want them Staff were friendly and very helpful You even get six free international phone calls from your room if you think you need the service This was very useful to me as roaming on my phone took two days to get activated so i definitely made use of this service You can t dial local Italian phone numbers though Go figure I would definitely stay here again ,0,281,1
 This hotel punches well above its weight It s like they took my list of things that really annoy me about hotels and made sure none of them were present I was incredibly impressed with this hotel Firstly it s not silly money for the location That got me there in the first place and it exceeded my expectations in every respect Check in is excellent Lots of staff all of whom were friendly efficient This is repeated throughout the hotel It s properly crewed and service is excellent in every department Early check in was handled charmingly and luggage stored properly Unusual for many hotels Our room was superb Small but very high quality They managed to fit in a proper sized desk decent armchair Nespresso machine and all the usual gubbins decent sized bed with great pillows decent linen The aircon actually cooled the room too The hotel is in an ugly purpose built concrete block and the huge advantage of this was the rooms are very quiet Interior d cor is great all comfy and great ambience Bathroom was a decent size and most unusually for hotels these days had enough shelving for all your stuff and a mirror that was actually lit enough to use Breakfast is impressive Firstly you get your tea and coffee within seconds of sitting down It s always a pleasant shock when that happens It s well staffed the food is kept stocked and the quality is high They ve got all the usual stuff and the quality of the cooked breakfast was great This place was a treat Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely go back ,0,279,1
 We didn t realize until we arrived that the hotel was in the VERY last stage of renovation I don t know what it looked like before but we loved our experience It s a small intimate kind of setting The room was affordable and spacious enough for two people and also our luggage Modern decor Room had a street view but was not loud An occasional siren in the morning but nothing overnight The bathroom was completely redone and high end equipped with fancy amenities including a hand towel warmer There is always a staff member at the desk 24 7 You are asked to leave your room key behind when you leave which makes sense No risk of losing and someone is always there to answer the front door Location in the city is key Right by the Museum d orsay and corresponding metro stop We re from NYC and like to walk so we walked to the Eiffel Tower another time to the Marais but did make use of the convenient subway stop Free wifi I had a personal and work iphone going at the same time and service was fast Do not stay here if you require room service 24 7 but if you re looking for a quaint very well located hotel with completely new and modern decor it was September so they hadn t yet unwrapped the gas fireplace in the lobby and want a nice quiet kind of fancy way to retire to your room book As we were leaving the nice woman in the lobby after calling us a taxi said We hope to see you again They will ,0,279,1
 This place is a little jewel of Paris I wanted something particularly French for my visit and Hotel Varenne was everything I had hoped for I chose one of the larger suites which was worth every cent The room was large the bed so comfy and the room was beautiful They even have an elevator albeit tiny but many Parisian and French hotels don t have that luxury The staff are all so friendly and helpful and catered to my needs beautifully and gracefully There is a grocery store across the street an organic store also and a patisserie bakery right next door with delicious croissants to go There are also many places to eat within walking distance The heavenly Rodin museum in the next street Les Invalides a short stroll metro very close 6 minutes walk only a 10 minute walk to the Musee D Orsay and yet this part of town is not as chaotic as other parts I visited I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again anytime I come to Paris Do be aware that you need to hand in your key each time you leave even if it s just next door to grab a croissant however given the number of pickpockets around and the level of hotel and room details on your key this is for your own safety as much as theirs There is a safe in the room which was big enough to store all my precious items and seriously I forgot to lock it one day and none of my stuff was touched Overall my experience was that it s a great place to stay ,0,279,1
 I took my Nephew away for his 21st birthday trying to be a good Uncle and we needed a 2 twin bed arrangement When we arrived it was a King Queen not sure but I asked the desk to review my request and she said no problem we will correct it very nice at front desk Came back after some coffee and they gave us the same room with the king bed a roll away bed cot next to the closet which now we could t open Went down to front desk and then they apologized and said they would will fix it I asked can we just get another room They said no rooms available not sure about that Anyway they put 2 twin beds in the same room took out the king bed and left the cot So now we have 2 twin beds pushed together and a cot I asked can we have this cot removed we need to get into the closet Also need the beds to be separated Okay we will be right there they said from down at the front desk very pleasant I explained to the maids that came that we will not be sleeping together during the trip so the beds need to be separated which my nephew and I already were doing Her response was get this lol oh now don t fight your trip just started When she left my nephew said I think she thinks All in all The rooms are nice and the hotel great Location was perfect I recommend the trip If you can afford the larger room go for that and enjoy ,0,278,1
 Excellent service from all hotel staff Beautiful interior design Understated Exterior Everything looks larger than it does in the website photos Supersonic room service About 90 seconds Beat that Great location Marco Pierre White restaurant in hotel Exquisite restaurant Excellent service from all restaurant staff Located amongst the modern architecture of London such as The Gherkin The Cheesegrater and The Walkie Talkie this exquisite modern hotel is camouflaged by its much older exterior architecture Only a small name plaque adorns the discreet entrance to an oasis of modern luxury and sophistication The perfect environment for the smart suited lady or gentleman to drink champagne My girlfriend and I chose this 5 star hotel as we were attending the ballet and wanted to feel comfortable in a hotel wearing evening dress and we did In a lesser starred hotel in the past we had felt out of place and uncomfortable The Marco Pierre White restaurant being the restaurant where hotel guests eat was a major factor in our choice of hotel Not all 5 star hotels have famous Chefs restaurants The room Our Deluxe Queen Room had a bath and a shower wet room with lots of marble and lovely toiletries Not a large room but not small it was beautifully furnished and was more impressive in d cor and size than it looked in the website photos Everything you need is in the room from robes and slippers to iron hairdryer and mini bar All I needed was ice Room service brought that with a big smile in about 90 seconds Beat that I will certainly return to this gorgeous place Enjoy your stay Mr SuitAndTie,0,277,1
 I suppose as a chef myself and working in the hospitality industry for nearly 20 years I am a bit more critical than most in some aspects my first disappointment was on arrival not being notified of the changeover in hotel names so arriving and finding holiday inn instead of kengsington close I first taught I was at the wrong hotel reception was caotic my reservation wasn t on the system and found staff unapologetic in such case my first impression was not great to say the least however as I do suffer from allergies and when requesting certain items from the hotel the staff was very diligent and accommodating I did feel the single room was extremely overpriced for the basic it contained but I will allow for the location which was fantastic would have loved to have been greated in some aspect of my stay by an English accent as I felt I at times was staying in an easten European city instead of the centre of London at times by the accents however most were very kind but when you hear staff speaking among themselves in there own languages can be very unnerving and intimidating to say the least overall as much a I had a lovely stay location being the most advantage to be honest I would doubt a return to this hotel again from working in this industry I am probably more Critical than your adverage customer to me it was in many ways of 4 star standard but as I m sure as it s a new venture for a new company best of luck in the future Ann Marie,0,277,1
 The staff at the hotel were so lovely and we were greeted so kindly on the first day The ladies at the front desk spoke really good english which made sorting out the payments for the rooms much easier She also gave us a map and showed us destinations she thought we may like to visit Our room was on the smaller side but it was decorated so nicely our friends were in rooms just opposite and theres were much larger The shower in the bathroom was amazing and all the facilities were up to a high standard of cleanliness We had our rooms cleaned 4 5 nights and they would look immaculate each time Originally we were going to stay in a hotel with a similar name which was blue the blue water or something like that but after reading the reviews online we changed to this one Would definitely recommend to anyone who is going on their first trip as there is a tram number 12 which stops just a minute walk from the hotel and you only have to change over once onto the 14 at bos den lommerweg in order to get to Dam Square You can also buy tram tickets and other tourist attraction tickets at the front desk but they can sell out so if you can buy your tram tickets at the actual station I would do that instead The buffet there was amazing and they had such a large variety of food from ice cream to sushi Overall our experience there was amazing and I will definitely be coming again on my next trip to Amsterdam ,0,276,1
 We had two rooms one classic double and one junior suite We loved the classy soft furnishing of the room The marble bathroom was spacious and clean The air conditioning worked really well for the hot and humid weather in July The classic double is a bit small in size Nonetheless it has a big and really comfortable bed a well sized wardrobe armchairs coffee table etc Our three adult children had the junior suite It was roomy for three persons The bedroom was very spacious and one felt really comfortable to be in They had no problems to spread out their suitcases and shopping The bathroom was big with marble all round like the one in the double room but bigger in size The hotel is located in a quieter street There are many high end shops in the area The metro station is approx five minute walk from the hotel and there s a taxi stand nearby Taxi fare is quite reasonable in Milan It is a good option to have when you want to go to the other side of the town to join a tour Brera is a trendy and vibrant area nearby about ten minute walk away There are lots of restaurants to choose from the Pinacoteco di Brera an excellent art gallery not to be missed to visit and lovely little shops to browse into We arrived at the hotel from Milano Centrale railway station by taxi On departure the hotel reception has arranged a Mercedes van to drop us back to the station Both fares were reasonably charged compared to those of Rome where we last stayed ,0,276,1
 The hotel is awesome It is strategically located on the small nice street right at the corner of Madleine square so that you could easily walk either to Champs lys es or to Grand Boulevards Opera area There is an underground parking on the same street very convenient for anyone arriving by car normally you do not need car in Paris it is much nicer to walk here so it is worth to park the car during your stay Hotel provide 10 discount for the parking you have to bring and stamp your parking ticket at the reception to validate the discount Parking price is 28 Euro night The room is really big especially according to Paris standards It is a little bit too dark and too grey at my taste but at the same time I must admire that it is really stylish The lobby is perfectly furnished and decorated so you could spend some minutes just sitting and relaxing there to feel the atmosphere Staff is enough friendly and trained Wi fi connection is stable enough Bathroom needs some things to be fixed and I would add that comfort and convenience were sacrificed here in from of designers ideas Anyway it is just my small remark and I would not say it is a kind of minor point Spoil yourself with Hermes shower gel and shampoo I would expect better housekeeping here cleaning was not enough I can surely recommend this hotel for everyone visiting Paris and I would say that it is worth to pay the room price even if I consider the value as a little bit too high ,0,275,1
 Hotel was within easy walking distance to Gare Du Nord train station The room decor was very modern trendy which gave the room a nice upscale feel very trendy The room we were in was a Jr Suite It was very roomy for the three adults in our party It had one large bed I believe it was a king and a couch sofa bed which was rather comfy The bathroom was quite large due to rainfall shower setup no shower doors While the shower setup was very nice it did leave the surrounding bathroom floor quite wet so some we had to mop it up after each use One of the best features of the hotel was its super close proximity to the Poissonniere Metro subway stop The stop was literally right outside the hotel door It wasn t a busy stop so people and traffic noise were quite low Several nice Cafes were in all directions as were a number of convenience stores for wine water snacks etc The front desk staff were very nice helpful We were able to store our luggage after we checked out while we did some final exploring before our train to London A small refrigerator was in the room which was nice to keep water drinks food chilled There was also a coffee machine in the room Keurig like but ours did not function well The bath towels were very large and plush but the bed pillows were a bit soft for my taste The hotel did offer breakfast but we thought it was a bit pricey so we did not take advantage of it ,0,275,1
 I stayed for three nights The location is excellent easy walking distance from Marylebone High Street and also many other local restaurants The thing that really makes this hotel stand out is the customer service I felt really looked after and safe which is important to me as a single female I loved the cocktail lounge the live music was really good and the cocktails excellent and some were quite unique not just the usual suspects The bedroom and the whole hotel was immaculately clean and well presented The coffee at breakfast is very good nice and strong and there was a good buffet breakfast very multicultural choice My only bug bear with this hotel is that I found the bed to be extremely uncomfortable I mentioned this to the reception supervisor after my first night and she went to great lengths to try to resolve the situation but regrettably is was not possible On night 2 I was dancing till 4 in the morning so would have slept on a washing line and I wouldn t have noticed but night 3 was still terribly uncomfortable Now this could just be me being fussy about my bed and the hotel did try hard to resolve it but nonetheless I do stay at a lot of hotels and don t have this problem I would love to make this my hotel of choice when down in London as it is so brilliant in all other aspects but a bed is a pretty fundamental thing to get right in a hotel I would have given this hotel a 10 if the bed had been comfortable,0,274,1
 We were right in the thick of things with Notre Dame and the Louvre just across the bridge The staff was wonderful Breakfast was great The rooftop bar is a big hit Watch the lights on the Eiffel Tower from the bar without having to trudge over there at night Hotel is very clean rooms have just been redone Some say the rooms are small but I m 6 4 and we had lots of room to store our stuff and move around Anyway how much waking time do you spend in your room while in Paris Location is near everything including both metro and rail line Very quiet though Can t say enough good things Lots of great restaurants around Cafe de Paris was a huge hit They had great food and staff and we wound up eating there many nights Waiters and manager got to know us and gave us hugs when we arrived Stay away from Brasserie Allard over priced 82 e for just a roast chicken add vegie wine and cocktail and bill was 175 e with raw chicken The waiters never came back to check and all my arm waving did nothing to get their attention Finally just paid bill and left They could care less Others were having similar problems and nasty waiters Just outside the hotel is a bodega with everything you d need from electrical gadgets to fruit Cafe St Andre is great for lunch try the huge Norwegian Salad loaded with smoked salmon Pictures are of Sasha our waiter at Cafe de Paris and the residential courtyard we overlooked real Paris ,0,272,1
 This hotel was perfectly located just a 10 minute walk to the beach where there are lots of seafood restaurants and bars The hotel is a 3 4 minute walk from the metro Bogatell giving you fast access to other areas in Barcelona There are also bars and restaurants close to the hotel for example D9 across the road which did great tapas You can take a beautiful walk into the city centre in less then half an hour by walking through the stunning Ciutadella Park me and my friend would walk into the centre gothic quarter etc rather than get the metro as we found this to be a perfect way to take in Barcelona The hotel had excellent facilities it was a fresh clean modern hotel The beds were extremely comfortable the staff were very friendly and willing to help the spa was amazing value for money the pool was perfect breakfast was also excellent From our bedroom window we had a view of the Sagrada Familia which was only a 25 minute walk from the hotel you could get the metro For those who like to go out and party Razzmatazz is literally round the corner from the hotel and was an awesome night out it is a huge cool venue with the party going on till 6 am I definitely recommend In all I would definitely go back to this hotel in the future There is nothing bad to say about it It made a delightful base from which to explore and enjoy Barcelona I would 100 recommend this hotel for singles couples groups families everyone ,0,272,1
 We have just checked out from one of the friendliest hotels we ve stayed at in a long time From our initial confirmation of booking to leaving we were treated extremely well We booked 5 nights in one of the executive rooms which was well worth the extra cost The room was clean modern and had the extra terrace view over the Belvedere Garden and the rest of Vienna As a surprise for my wife she was given a free 25min massage voucher which gave me 25min Bar time The bar staff were great and a great source of tourist information and a bowl of complimentary peanuts with beer The hotel is a good 20 min walk to the centre of town but the walk isn t boring or unsafe in fact wherever we walked seemed comfortable and safe Breakfast time was busy which made us feel like we were in the right place It gave my wife a good chance to people watch and me to ignore my calories While she had a selection of fresh fruit veg local cheeses pastries and the odd omelette I was gorging on the scrambled egg sausages bacon fresh salmon cereal selection fruits etc there was so much more What I m trying to say is that there was nothing inedible It was all great The Executive Suite also gave us access to the Executive restaurant We could access this room during the day for extra snacks drinks prawn cocktail beef wrap chocolate mousse etc which also became a great comfort in our day Any way all good Thank you Austria Trend ,0,271,1
 A beautiful boutique hotel that absolutely ticked every box The staff were all very polite and helpful the room was lovely I asked for a quiet room and my 1st floor deluxe double was extremely well appointed with a luxury feel and a great modern bathroom My room size was compact but it really wasn t an issue The bedroom had a large LED television and there was also a screen over the bath very swish The lighting in the bathroom was very good and made applying my makeup a breeze often a problem in other hotels There was no parking on site nor any street parking locally However I used JustPark and managed to park off road nearby in a residential area overnight for 10 70 and it was a 6 minute walk away I had a Chicken Caesar Salad for dinner and it was excellent best I ve had for years Breakfast was truly superb the best English Breakfast I ve had bar none sorry mum Lovely morning staff too really made the start to the day a pleasure The bed was excellent and I had a terrific night s sleep with no noise from the street or other guests I found this hotel by chance and I wasn t too sure if Acton was perhaps too far out from the City but the location was actually really good with swift access to and from the M4 So it s without any hesitation I wholeheartedly recommend this lovely hotel to business users looking for high standards without any stuffiness I know you won t be disappointed ,0,270,1
 This is a grande olde Dame of a hotel very charming right opposite Russell Square It is undergoing careful renovation but this is not noticeable or bothersome I stayed near the top floors and renovation has not reached there as yet I quite liked that fact and I have to say it was very nice to stay in such an olde hotel Some reviewers have criticised the older rooms but I did not find fault and I stayed in a small double Everything worked wifi was high speed water was very hot TV had plenty channels Housekeeping was very good I have stayed in very upmarket hotels over the years and yes Russell is showing her age at the top but this is being repaired A brief problem on the floor with a tripped fuse was resolved within ten minutes by Maintainance unlike a previous Hotel Du Vin that I stayed in where they did not even fix an issue in my room my entire stay so very very good staff taking care of everything All the staff from the Doormen Conci rge to Reception were very nice and helpful to me Sometimes I think guests have a duty to be decent guests also and respect the olde spirt of the hotel you stay in regarding negative reviewers on this site Walking down the staircase was lovely each morning and the emerging marble lower down was fantastic you must meet George the lucky dragon he brought great luck to me that week of my stay Good olde Grande Dame Lovely staff Will benefit from her renovation within ,0,269,1
 Where do you stay in a big busy city We were passing through on the train from Switzerland on our way to Bobbio As we had already booked Hotel Berna for a few days after our Bobbio visit we decided to call in on our way and luckily there was a very comfortable room available for an overnight Reception is helpful and friendly The location s great for trains to and from Milano Centrale just a few minutes walk away and there are plenty of nice restaurants nearby We had a good night s sleep and no disturbances When we returned for our pre booked four night stay we arrived a little early and had to wait about twenty minutes for our room to be ready We were invited to sit comfortably in the hotel lounge with coffee biscuits and buns and newspapers to read Our bedroom was very modern and comfortable with a very efficient bathroom albeit not very large Guests are invited to choose pillows towels drinks for the fridge even toilet paper when registering on line Everything we chose was in place and daily refills are made except for shampoo etc Breakfast is extremely good with a wide choice served from 7am to 11am which really is a great time span for those of us on holidays All the staff at Hotel Berna are pleasant and cheerful and made our stay here very special The hotel and its sister hotel in Lugano Switzerland are members of the Swiss Hotels Association and this is reflected very well with the extremely competent management of the hotel ,0,269,1
 I loved this hotel It s elegant and has a wonderful vibe to it The staff are amazing and very welcoming and they know how to make you feel special The happy hour at their bar is just perfect as they offer cocktails that are so nice and for just 5 5 Euro The mattress owh what can i say about that they invested in these mattresses as they have Memory foam Mattresses which makes you feel like you are sleeping on clouds For me i actually don t prefer these kind of mattresses as they are too soft for my back as i have back problems so i do actually prefer firm mattresses but i didn t mind sleeping on it for one night The furniture decore is just wonderful and feels posh The bathroom has a wonderful rainfall shower and great basin The offer toothbrush paste which i find very handy for someone who is on the move This kind of service wasn t even offered by Movinpeckhotel The hotel is also very close to shops and amazing restaurants all around The tram is just couple of steps from the hotel The view from my room wasn t much but i knew about this as i didn t book the room that faces the canals i was on the 1st floor but you need to keep in mind some rooms are in the top floor or the basement therefore these rooms might not even have a good view and might be smaller with no windows hince some of the reviews here that might seem misleading ,0,269,1
 From the moment we stepped through the doors of the Guesthouse Hotel the staff could not have done more for my boyfriend and I nor been more helpful accommodating and pleasant The rooms were beautifully presented and very well designed with the bathrooms having wonderfully large waterfall showers and gorgeous Molten Brown toiletries As it was our anniversary we were presented with a beautiful hand written welcome card and some cakes upon arrival in our room which was a lovely personal touch An additional highlight was when upon realising I had forgotten my toothbrush I was delighted to be provided with a complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste by the concierge Room service was extremely fast and efficient and the food was just lovely we had breakfast each morning and some cakes for afternoon tea would highly recommend the mini lemon meringue pies The mini bar was extremely well stocked and we were thrilled to find that the majority of the goods were complimentary including bottles of wine and beer amazing value The hotel itself is in an excellent location across from the beautiful Albertina museum and a short walk from the opera houses While the hotel is tucked away on a quiet street there is some great shopping and Christmas markets just around the corner From start to finish we had an absolutely wonderful stay and I honestly could not recommend this hotel enough It is excellent value for money and worth every penny we just wish we could have stayed another night or two Thank you so much Guesthouse Staff Sincerely Young Couple from Dublin Ireland ,0,268,1
 Our experience completely exceeded expectations Last time we were in Barcelona we stayed at Hotel Arts but frankly enjoyed our experience at Olivia Balmes more We went to the Arts for lunch a couple of times during this trip and this reinforced our opinion that it could be much more pleasant to stay in a good centrally located 4 star hotel with warm staff than a big impersonal luxury resort We travelled as a group of 8 and reserved 3 different types of rooms double triple and suite and were very pleased with all of them They were all spacious and bright and clean Everyone at the hotel bent over backwards to be friendly and helpful As we arrived well before check in time we waited in the restaurant and had beer and coffee Upon requesting a bill we were told that those were our complimentary welcome drinks Later one member of the group had a minor health issue and needed to see a doctor The lady at the front desk couldn t have been more helpful She walked the guest to a nearby clinic and translated his ailment to the doctor who promptly and effectively dealt with the issue Although the hotel is centrally located it still exuded a sense of calm The entrance is very well appointed indeed there is space for cars to load and drop off and there is a taxi bay right across the street This will be our go to hotel in Barcelona We enjoyed hospitality at its best and at very reasonable prices with no nickeling and diming ,0,267,1
 Fabulous modern city hotel excellent facilities and great service all round The hotel staff were totally efficient and professional and very friendly and helpful and our room and facilities were perfect we couldn t fault the hotel whatsoever The location by the river is interesting and the river view from the room we had was beautiful particularly in the evening London heliport is next door and if your room is on that side of the hotel the infrequent arrivals and departures of helicopters add interest The hotel bar and restaurant are modern and welcoming and the food was very good and reasonably priced The service on the night we were there lacked a little in performance but the effort and desire to please could not be questioned so perhaps it was either down to new staff or an off night The location of the hotel is something of a challenge if you are staying to visit the city and some planning is needed It is located some way from the centre of the city and the nearest tube stations are around 35 minutes walk from the hotel however don t let that put you off Taxis are the obvious and easiest way of getting in and out of the city although we preferred to use the hotel s hourly courtesy car service to Clapham junction and then overground or national rail services in and out which were all easy to use with very regular trains The return leg from Clapham junction to the hotel is around 15 minutes by foot All round an excellent stay ,0,267,1
 Firstly the location was so central for accessing everything we wanted to see by walking by Metro and by tourist buses Secondly the staff were wonderful You can help yourself to coffee and pastries every time you step in the door but if the staff see you they will offer to make your coffee they are delightful There is no bar but when we wanted to celebrate a special birthday the staff were more than happy to provide glasses and an ice bucket and we bought our own drinks at the shop over the road We sat and drank it in the cosy and comfortable seating area looking out onto a pretty courtyard We had opted for a room with a terrace which was on the 6th floor It wasn t cheap but we do enjoy being able to step outside from our room and we weren t disappointed the terrace was spacious with plants at the sides and enough room for our friends to sit out with us around the patio table I regret that we didn t find time to enjoy the sauna etc it all looked very nice We tried the breakfast the first morning and it was so good we decided to have breakfast there every day They thought of everything I particularly enjoyed the fresh summer fruits Little touches like the welcome gifts lovely spacious shower complimentary half bottle of Champagne for my husband s birthday large flat screen TV and helpful advice on the desk at all times made the whole experience very special Thank you Hotel Moliere ,0,266,1
 This was an outstanding experience in every way The room was actually larger than I anticipated decorated in quality period original or reproduction decor with a roomy bathroom very tastefully done and two small armoires The location is perfect in the heart of the Latin Quarter set back from a busy street in a charming cul de sac I enjoyed sipping my coffee on the tiny balcony each morning and the lobby is a joy to return to after wandering about Paris The staff went out of its way to be helpful and responsive I would stay here again if I had the good fortune to return to Paris at any time Beware the tiny Parision elevator of course only large enough for two people or one person plus one suitcase and three steps on each floor above 0 from the elevator to the rooms I can t comment on breakfast because I only used my very tiny but completely adequate minibar fridge overstuffed with offerings of wine etc to buy microwave stovetop and sink I was even provided with two settings of plates wine glasses flatware wine opener and a large pot The only insignificant drawbacks were that the door to my room was such a tight fit that I almost needed help opening it and the somewhat shaky outlets are all near the floor so charging devices with my own adapters for European outlets was a challenge The cleaning service was a bit uneven But I didn t really mind any of these drawbacks because the overall advantages were so wonderful ,0,265,1
 What a fabulous trip From the minute we walked in the desk staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming The car park was fully booked when we arrived but we were provided clear simply direction to a near by alternative and upon our return to the Catalonia Atenas were given vouchers for a free drink each to make up for this 5 minute inconvenience It was entirely unexpected and immediately made us feel like valued guests The room was excellent too immaculate and comfortable The free Wi Fi was easy to access and worked perfectly for both of us the whole time though our usage was not extensive Not to be out done by reception the Bar staff were friendly and could not do enough to help extremely attentive but not intrusive As a side note the tapas served in the bar was very tasty indeed check out the asparagus The rooftop pool is small but nice we enjoyed our brief splish The real bonus here though is that the seating lounging area around it gives fantastic views over this part of the city With Sagrada Familia so close this is a great spot for photo ops Overall we were bowled over by our stay in the Catalonia Atenas it ticked very single box Good food great atmosphere a metro station directly adjacent and only 5 stops to La Rambla courteous and helpful staff and very comfortable clean rooms Not only would i recommend to others it will be my first port of call next time I m in Barcelona ,0,264,1
 The service at check in dining and room service were excellent The staff were extremely courteous and helpful Especially Roger at Front desk Diego and a few at front desk and concierge that I did not get their names Asta in dining room and Judith from room service all very nice I talked to Roger a couple of times before my visit to enquire location and places nearby he was extremely patient Roger was able to able arrange early check in and even upgraded two rooms as I explained to him that I was travelling with my two senior friends at 70 and would be good for them to arrive with a room available in early morning The location of the hotel is extremely convenient Just 5 to 10 minutes walk from the Le Rambla Catalonia Square shopping centres Next to the hotel was a 24 hour grocery store with good fruits snacks toiletries etc there were also a caf and a McDonald At the end of the block is a really good salad bar called Organics Across the street is a huge department store with a taxi stand The hotel also provide a buffet with sandwiches fruits beverages hot soup entr e with vegetables salad cheeses bread yoghurt milk tea and coffee on complimentary from 2 PM to 11 PM every day We were very busy so no time to check on the health club pool and rooftop Book this and you won t regret The owner of the hotel is so lucky to have such a great team ,0,262,1
 Lovely hotel I stayed here in June 2016 with a group of friends and then rebooked after my first visit and stayed in December 2016 with my husband The rooms are a good size as are the beds When staying with friends we had three beds in each room and there was still plenty of room to move around and get ready The bathrooms are a nice size too modern and very clean The staff were very helpful and accommodating we needed an iron one night and one was brought to our room within 5 minutes of the request to reception They also printed off tickets for trips we had booked online The hotel is a little out of the Centre however there is a tram stop straight outside the front of the hotel and the trams runs late We found that from collecting our bags at the airport we were at the hotel checking in within the hour this was after catching the train to the main station and then the tram to the hotel Their are plenty of bars and restaurants around the hotel too and the Italian restaurant in the hotel is nice if you fancy eating in one night This is a great hotel and I have recommended it to a few people since I have returned I would certainly use it again should I return to Amsterdam On both occasions we arrived before midday and we were able to check in early Free Wifi is also a bonus ,0,255,1
 The location was Fantastic three minute walk to the London Bridge The globe theatre and the tower brige are also very near I would say for sight seeing it s fantastic there are a lot of monuments in the area If you want to do some shopping it s not so great although there are a couple of shops around The hotel itself is really outdated The room was really dusty When I opened the curtains there was dust when I sat on the bed dust rose up I am not over exaggerating My nose got blocked and I couldn t stop sneezing the whole time I was there The bathroom was outdated too Only had a shower and no tub And it would steam up really bad a sauna literally and it took a long time for it to clear up On a positive note they have a lot of free stuff Free cans of drinks chocolate and nuts in the lobby Free unlimited wifi which doesnt require a password It has a computer suite which has a free printer and a gym I didn t really use any but it was good that they were there Oh it had a funny smell to Overall it is not the worst however the level cleanliness was disappointing oh I forgot to mention they had a basket of toilet tissues under the bed it may not bother some however it bothers me also it needs MAJOR refurbishing it too old Hope it helps ,0,254,1
 Having lived in South Kensington in the 90s I was aware of the excellent location It is literally across the round from Gloucester Rd tube station and thus on the Piccadilly line direct from Heathrow alternative is the quicker but rather more expensive Heathrow Express to Paddington then underground on the District and Circle line The hotel has an impressive foyer Reception is friendly and efficient The hotel is decorated with period photos and decorations My bedroom looked out onto reasonably busy Gloucester Rd yet thanks to double glazing there was little street noise The room was was a nice size with attractive furnishing very clean functional with a good sized desk and two comfortable chairs The bathroom was excellent The room was serviced to a very high standard Laundry though expensive is quick and reliable I was given free wifi which worked well I was not disturbed by internal noise I ate breakfast at local cafes and once in the hotel which was a standard cooked buffet with sufficient choices There are plenty of places to eat locally cafes restaurants and two pubs with a larger and better choice 10 minutes walk away on Old Brompton Road Getting into central London is easy via the Underground I also recommend walking around the area 30 minutes to Chelsea High St Kensington and to Knightsbridge London hotels can be pricey for not much however Baileys is very good value for all the above reasons I can certainly see myself staying there again ,0,253,1
 The second we walked through the door the staff were brilliant A great welcome that immediately put us in a great mood The beds were amazing so much so that my partner and I went as far as to say they were the comfiest bed we ve ever slept in ever The small touches and attention to detail went a long way also we booked our trip over the Easter weekend and the staff set up an Easter egg hunt in the room with complimentary prosecco Rooms were amazing hotel in general was amazing Free wifi for those of you who can t part with your phone We only had the breakfast there during our stay and it was equally as amazing as the comfortable beds I especially loved how the breakfast buffet had fresh smoothies to drink as well as a great selection in both the buffet and main dishes We fell in love with Amsterdam in its entirerity and will no doubt be back and soon we can 100 we will stay here again it made our trip even better Also if a lot like my partner and I you like to be in the less busier but much quirkier parts of town location wise it couldn t be better Small walk away from the museums and a tram stops right outside the hotel It s also right next to a canal as well as being on a street full of lovely Dutch bakeries bars cafes and coffee shops ,0,253,1
 Me and my two friends in our twenties stayed here to celebrate the new year We found this hotel to be the best we ve ever stayed in and would definitely come here again Location It is in an ideal location just down the road from the Anne Frank house There is a tram stop at the end of the road about a 2 minute walk away which tram 13 or 17 takes you directly to central station in under 7 minutes Also next to the tram stop is a handy supermarket There was peace and quiet at night time which was ideal Hotel The hotel itself is stunningly decorated We were welcomed to a bottle of moet champagne The bedroom was roomy and the bed was the comfiest I ve ever slept in There was a posh coffee machine which was great as well as a fridge although the snacks in there you pay for but we used it for our own food drink The bathroom had the most amazing tub and shower and the Ritual toiletries were complimentary and gorgeous You get given cosy robes and towels are changed each day Very impressive Staff Absolutely amazing staff So helpful and patient explaining directions and providing their top recommendations The hotel contacted me before arrival with tips on restaurants so helpful Special mention to Roxanne who me and the girls found to be so helpful throughout our stay You must try this hotel you will not be disappointed ,0,251,1
 Amazing location right by the historic center 5 minute walk to Sforza Castle and 15 minute walk to Piazza del Duomo Galleria Vittorio Emanuelle Lots of small bars osterias restaurants and trattorias around the hotel with great wine shops as well I recommend the Meat Shop 50 meters away from the hotel personally There s also a nice Le Creuset store 200 meters south Everything is basically located within walking range Staff at check in was very polite and spoke perfect English Ladies responsible for breakfest and dinner were amazingly sweet to my children and really perfect overall Breakfest was tasty with all sorts of coffee drinks made to order One of the best Latte Machiato I ever had really I only wish they had prosciutto crudo alongside coto but it was very good nonetheless Room was spacious very clean and silent despite Brera being a notorious bohemian neighborhood Very strong shower heads were awesome as well I recommend this hotel to anyone considering escaping from the historic centre because of its notorious high prices Even though the Carlyle Brera was not cheap it was better priced than the alternative And like I said it is located right outside the dreadful ZTL but still within walking distance from the Duomo Anyway if you mistakingly drive through the ZTL to get to the hotel they still offer you a form that is sent to the police so you won t get ticketed Thank you Carlyle Brera staff ,0,248,1
 We stayed here for two days and loved it Charming boutique hotel with the best rooftop bar in town Location right by the beach walkable to many good bars restaurants etc Service housekeeping good we had a prompt check in They even gave us early check in and were helpful with information etc They charge 10 euros per hour for a late checkout Room not so big but okay for a couple We tried the classic room on 3rd floor but the patio which is actually just a french window opens towards the veranda on the inside of the building so can be a little dark We then stayed on the 4th floor in a classic room with a patio which was much nicer as it was a little bigger with a small patio you could actually open and step out a bit on the patio if you want it s very small but still a patio Lots of light much better than the inside open window as this patio opened towards the side street Can be a little noisy as there are bars on the side street but we didn t mind it that much We didn t eat at the hotel but we tried the rooftop bar and it was great The rooftop bar is perfect for a sunny drink and some snacks We actually enjoyed the rooftop bar the most Definitely recommend this hotel to anybody exploring Barcelona while staying by the water ,0,248,1
 The hotel has a very nice setting but is located next to a park that is quite remote The website is not transparant about this Our taxi to the hotel ended up in traffic jam for cars trying to get into the park Furthermore the location is very remote It takes at least half an hour to get up to the mountain Once there the view is spectacular the pool and spa are fantastic although the sauna requires some maintenance The rooms are comfortable The prices of drinks just coffee however is quite over the top It s ok to pay a bit more in a good location but 5 or 6 Euro for a cup of coffee is too much We decided to take the bus from the busstop adjacent to the hotel to go downtown The bus did not accept credit or debit cards We were sent to the hotel to get money from a money machine It was not there Then we had to go into the park to get money The next bus would not accepts bills of 20 Euro So missed that bus too Then we had to change the money in the hotel which fortunately they did So after 1 hour we had the 3rd bus to go down The hotel could have provided bus tickets or whatsoever to accommodate guests The bus ticket was half a cup of coffee and it took us one hour to arrange it ,0,247,1
 The location of the Krasnapolsky cannot be bettered The view of the bustling Dam square and the palace from the front rooms is an additional bonus It is a very busy hotel with business travellers the young and trendy making up the majority of the guests Nevertheless both Reception and the Concierge were both courteous and very helpful without undue delay We stayed in a Premium Double Room XL with View It is a very large high ceilinged sunny room with a whole wall of windows looking onto Dam Square Furnished in ubiquitous but pleasing modern chic it has a very comfortable XL king bed and space to swing many cats at once And lots of sockets for charging devices etc The bathroom has his n hers washbasins a separate rain shower and a toilet A series of mirror panels open it up to the bedroom Toiletries were replenished twice a day Cannot fault cleanliness and the willing housekeeping staff Breakfast at the conservatory like restaurant was a mixture of the excellent and the mediocre Fresh juices and smoothies fresh pastries stunning bread and a good selection of fruit and cooked food Cheese is sliced and dried up a let down for a cheese country like the Netherlands Hudson s Terrace Restaurant provides well prepared and well priced contemporary dishes and deserts in a contemporary setting whilst enjoying views of the ever bustling square The wifi is free efficient and works throughout the hotel ,0,246,1
 There s nothing to not like about this hotel the staff are always lovely and welcome you with warmth and with a smile We have stayed in two single rooms both impeccably clean and well presented and designed Our recent room we stayed in had a set of stairs in that lead down to a bathroom and I could easily and happily live in that room it was perfect You have everything you need and it s nice to stay in a hotel that works on an actual key and lock system instead of a card that deactivates whenever it goes near your phone This hotel is charming in every way and is always a pleasure to stay in We will be returning again next January Only criticism I have is to the people on here that complain there is no breakfast and no lift the hotel states there is no lift so read before you book and breakfast it is only complimentary for hotels to give free breakfast away they have recommendations for nearby places that do breakfast which is kind of them to do so most hotels in London do not offer free breakfast or charge a ridiculous amount for it anyways Buy a packet of croissants make some tea and watch some morning telly together or if your travelling alone and have that in peace and quiet and at your own leisure Thank you for a wonderful stay once again ,0,245,1
 Absolutely beautiful hotel with incredible staff We arrived at 7pm and were met by 2 lovely receptionists who booked us quickly into our room along with 2 very yummy chocolate chip cookies believe me take them when they offer we asked for more the following day We were going to the O2 to watch Bruno Mars and were running behind schedule so I was panicking when we arrived however the receptionists couldn t have put me more at ease they checked us in quickly and escorted us to our room The room itself was perfect a lovely size for the two of us I went with my boyfriend and was spotless It had everything you would need for an overnight stay we even were provided with toothbrushes at our request after forgetting ours and it was no bother at all to the staff They were constantly smiling and very friendly For the price I paid for the room I would 100 recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful hotel to stay in Uber s are available within 4 minutes of ordering and I honestly cannot fault the hotel Only thing I would say is I wish I ordered room service as the food looked incredible It was a 25 minute uber to Westminster which I think was 14 which was was ideal We spent the whole day being tourists and had a fabulous trip away mainly done to our stay at DoubleTree ,0,245,1
 Great stay I traveled with my daughter who was actually going to Tobago flying from London We wanted to have some time together before her big university trip I emailed the reception asking for a room with a nice view I got much more that I expected On the arrival we got two complimentary drinks we could decide what we want They did not offer us a chip wine In the room my daughter found lots of balloons and a card The card was prepared by a lovely member of staff Teela She made a huge effort as the card was containing some images from Tobago and a nice story It was a great personal touch Thank you The room itself is not very specious but it is lovely The bed is extremely comfortable Everything is operated by an iPad Lights TV there is a great sellection of movies The hotel Location is great Is literally next to the Tower Hill underground station The reception is nice and modern There are also computers you can use At the bar you can buy some food good selection for a very reasonable price The second night was interrupted by a fire alarm but this things happen I got an email in the morning explaining the situation and apologising for this I would highly recommended the hotel to everyone traveling to London for business or leisure and I will definately stay in the hotel again ,0,244,1
 The staff very friendly and easy to approach We booked two rooms and travelled with small baby and the lady at the reception was so kind to allocate us and my parents on the same floor She saw us coming with the baby stroller and accommodate us in a bigger corner room with more space I would definitely recommend that hotel if you are visiting Paris with a small baby The hotel rooms are really quiet and no noise from the street or neighbouring rooms There is also a lift very tiny but that s Paris so you should be happy to have one at all Lovely quiet street overlooking the park Nice design very clean Probably 5 min walk from the nearest metro station but we used it once as we walked pretty much everywhere Very comfortable bed Location is good if you not looking for a very busy part of Paris but close to Bastille or Nation If I would be visiting Paris again I would book that hotel for sure again Wifi really good My parents had much smaller room but with a sofa Their toilet was much smaller and the only comment from my dad was that if there would be bigger person than it would be quiet difficult for them to turn around in that toilet or get into shower but hey It s Paris and we liked the place and we fitted in the toilet LOL,0,243,1
 The hotel is barely 15 20 minutes bus ride BUS 73 from the terminal s door at Linate Airport the tickets are just 1 50 euro single from a machine at the stop on the way back get them from a news stand So no costly taxis necessary The receptionist was a beaming young lady very helpful with storing our luggage before the room was ready helpful with directions to near distant attractions She took the trouble to find out opening hours location of 3 local markets and gave us directions to Navigli a canal district packed with eateries She also remembered we asked for a room with windows opening for the night facing a side street And while there proved to be no kettle in the room as per usual in Italian hotels the kitchen served us tea at no added cost So staff were great The room itself bathroom were very clean with fantastic working shower loads of room to put the luggage In any case we came to La Scala to walk watch shop ourselves dizzy not to sit in the room But the bed was heavenly after the long day out the breakfast offered a wide choice including a fine selection of local dolci We are usually rather critical of hotels we stay at often move rooms sometimes more than once but there was no need for that at Bianca Maria Thank you we felt pampered ,0,242,1
 The Nadler Victoria just became our favorite hotel anywhere in the world What an amazing experience The staff was beyond professional and so helpful They exhibited the kind of customer service in the hospitality business a frequent traveler only dreams of In fact we didn t know it still existed So good on them Shout out to Sophie who was amazing and really helped make our short stay in London memorable The location couldn t be better close to Buckingham Palace walking distance to so many things and the tube is right there It s also super easy access to the train station at Victoria Station to get to the airport Gatwick direct Heathrow a couple stop overs but easy The room was huge and so comfortable They had a little kitchenette that was extremely helpful The beds are more comfortable then my own bed at home Big bathroom with lovely amenities The hotel does not have a restaurant which some folks list as a negative but I gotta say it really didn t matter It s very boutique style There are so many places close by to eat and also little bodega type mini marts so not having a bar or restaurant or that kind of full service hotel really didn t matter The location the rooms themselves and the staff won us over I ll never stay anywhere else in London again Fantastic value for the money ,0,241,1
 Westcord fashion hotel was fantastic I chose to stay slightly out of the centre of Amsterdam and this meant we could afford a nicer hotel Three minutes takes you to Surinameplaine tram stop and the 1 or 17 tram takes you into the centre in about 20 minutes The trams run every 6 minutes which is great Buy the 24 48 72 96 hour travel cards from reception and get on or off any tram any time The 4 day card was only 21 50 Vondelpark is nearby and this is a lovely walk into the centre if you have an hour to spare The pool was lovely and our room was kept clean every day with all toiletries replaced daily Although we didn t eat in the hotel we did use the sky rooftop bar every night Service was great and although the cocktails are expensive enough at 12 they were lovely and the beer was a good price As it was my husband s 30th I let the hotel know and we arrived to our room to find a voucher for a complimentary cocktail each in the sky bar We really appreciated this The hotel also stored our baggage after check out until we were ready to go to the airport If we go back to Amsterdam and we probably will as we loved it we would definitely stay at westcord fashion hotel again ,0,238,1
 Incredible hotel It s clearly 4 stars hotel Is by far the best I ever been and I travelled more than 30 countries The reception and lobby area are huge and well designed It has big restaurant there too big area with sofas and a big internet area with several computers Elevators are secured and activated with the room card The room was biger than my appartment All de details are clearly of design with matching colours and good quality furniture Enormous bed with two sofa chairs a long desk and big TV The reception of the room is spacious with a bench and big mirror the closet is big with a quality safe box The bathroom is huge and divided in two areas one with a longer and wider than the usual bath tube wall to wall mirror with designed furniture and matching colours The other area is for the WC and a bench All details are a great quality There s a gym in the last floor a small one but classy and with the basic mchines to stay fit and a great view of the whole city The terrasse has a small swimming pool to relax and chairs to take the sun with nice view of the sea The staff is very welcoming efficient and quick to answer The cleaning staff is alwys available 2 underground floors parking with lot of places available ,0,238,1
 I have reviewed this hotel previously as I was in and out of this little gem several times over my 5 1 2 week visit to Spain I spent a total of 18 nights at the Vilana It was close to my daughter s dorm and was very convenient for me The staff was wonderful friendly and helpful I stayed in three different rooms and each one had a nice view especially room 11 Lots of electrical outlets a little refrigerator hair dryer robe and slippers Comfy beds and pillows This isn t a posh hotel but I rated it as excellent because it is clean and comfortable and exactly what I was looking for The hotel is in a beautiful and safe residential neighborhood but close to restaurants banks shops and markets It is a ten minute walk to metro and 15 20 minutes on metro to Pla a Catalunya the hub of Barcelona The bus runs along Bonanova which is a half block away I enjoyed getting away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas at the end of the day to the peace and quiet of the Vilana neighborhood Airport cab fare was approximately 30 35 each way Fares to most popular venues my daughter and I visited was 10 15 but I usually took metro Also convenient for those needing to be near Teknon Hospital I thoroughly enjoyed the Vilana ,0,238,1
 The drive from the train station to our accommodation was not far would have been a good hour s drive if we had travelled from the airport Nice smallish hotel in a reasonable location We walked to the Milan cathedral from our hotel and it didn t take that long approximately 30 minutes Staff at the hotel helped with directions which was very much appreciated The hotel didn t have a restaurant so we dined out couple of recommendations from staff again Ate in an absolutely fabulous gourmet pizza place 5 minutes walk from our accommodation The best and I mean very best pizza we have ever eaten We have eaten pizza all over the world and definitely couldn t beat this one Room clean not big but after a bit of rearranging we could accommodate our 2 suitcases and move around still Breakfast reasonable but there is a charge of 10 00 euro s per person The hotel staff helped us with route decisions when we doing the Hop On Off bus this saved us a lot of time If you are in Milan and a bit of a foodie you should go to Peck an up market food place which is a bit like your Harrod s David Jones food courts Not far from the cathedral about a 5 minute walk All in all our short stay in Milan was lovely ,0,235,1
 This was a trip to celebrate my husbands 40th so we wanted something a little more special and I can honestly say Ohla did not disappoint Right from when we arrived the staff went out of their way a nice glass of fizz as a welcome and they held our bags so we could go off and explore the city while our room was being prepared The bar man Camilo upstairs gave us hints on where to visit tapas cocktail bars etc and the bar we found was the best cocktail bar we ve ever been in Crepe el born We arrived back to the room to a complimentary bottle of cava from the hotel for hubbys birthday and some gorgeous chocs Room was cleaned exceptionally every day and the staff were always happy to guide us to where we wanted to go Even smelt nice everywhere On our last day we had a later check out and staff held onto our bags as we had an evening flight so we could enjoy our last few hours When we returned we were allowed to use the gym area to shower before our flight and chill in the bar 4 days in the city flew by but we had the best time and Ohla definitely made it one to remember Can t thank the staff and management enough We will definitely be back ,0,234,1
 My sister and I bought our parents a trip to London for Christmas and we all went in the end of March We stayed at Grand Royal Hyde Park for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of it The staff was lovely and always very helpful the breakfast buffet was amazing with heaps of different things to chose from and the dining area had such nice old London interior which is what we wanted for our stay the rooms had a more modern feel interior and the rooms were a bit small but since you re always out and about while being in London anyways it didn t bother us at all as long as you have a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in we re a ok The hotel is basically across the street from Hyde park and only 2 min walk to Queens Way underground which easy takes you where ever you want around London Very centred perfect spot if you want to live close to basically everything So yeah definitely a place we would all return to A really nice hotel for such a decent price which is hard to find so centred in London in general Awesome staff and service Great breakfast and a really nice bar downstairs by the lobby for afternoon drinks before heading out for the evening Will definitely return ,0,233,1
 The Toren had given me a unique experience When I arrived at the reception I was immediately welcomed by the staff that would be taking care of my demands all over the hosting The kindness and the intention to help out are noticeable about the way the guest is spoiled with any requests or just with the attention of always leave fresh and chilled water at your disposal The room was very well decorated using an Amsterdam atmosphere and obviously some details can not be missed like the Nespresso coffee machine with some great coffee blends and the incredible sheets that helps the bed be more comfortable and perfect than ever The bathroom is another experience by itself as the floor is warm and the bathtub controls the scene with a full clean warm water jet and a perfect relaxing bath completed by lily and fluffy towels The breakfast is a unique experience pleasing to international taste they dispose many options fresh fruits cookies coffee tasty assorted breads and the service is located at the charming hotel bar making the experience even more authentic and enjoyable Well I don t believe is possible for me to written all the details that this pleasant experience in this hotel because the true experience is a great feeling that is a hard task to put into words Great work Toren Team Keep that way ,0,233,1
 I like the fact that staff has been very efficient in giving directions how to get to hotel from the airport how to get to different locations from the hotel where to eat etc It is very easy to get around because of the staff s spot on instructions for direction The staff is also always willing to help You feel the genuine concern that they have and they always want to make you feel as comfortable as possible The room was always clean when I get back from a day of touring different parts of Vienna The breakfast every morning was filling You could have fresh eggs cooked however you want it and hot chocolate There is an array of cold cuts cheeses breads spreads cereals and fruits I even had some food packed for snack for the rest of my day The location although a bit on the outskirt isn t a problem at all The transport system was efficient and it s nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and have a quiet and relaxing atmosphere where the hotel is Lastly when I checked out the nice lady gave me a free ticket to get to the airport because my 72 hour vienna card has already expired I appreciate the gesture again the entire staff make you feel as comfortable as possible ,0,232,1
 Nice hotel Room was beautiful and bed very comfortable Did not expect big rooms in Paris so size was really ok with 2 windows Bathroom modern and new with a GREAT shower Staff was wonderfull since reservation They sent me an email prior to my arrival asking if they could help me in anyway and also asking if I had any special needs such as extra beds I had a last minute health problem in the family and had to arrive one day earlier and stay for 1 night less Audrey was wonderful and managed to receive me before and dealt herself with Booking to change my reservation I sent a note to her when I was entering my flight from Cannes to Paris and when I left the airplane she had already sorted everything out They even charged me a lower rate as on the day I arrived the room costed a little less In this same day Saturday June 25 I went out with friends and arrived really hungry at the hotel at 1 30AM and the guy from reception can t believe I forgot his name Maybe Hadesmi managed to open the restaurant and get to my room a nice aspargus risoto bread yougurt and a warm smile even thought riom service finishes at midnight Really had a very nice experience at Monhotel and recomend it ,0,231,1
 1 Jason Harris the concierge guy who just brought back my faith into humanity My luggage was delayed and I had to stay in London for 4 days trying to contact the airlines airports and the baggage claim agencies If I was lucky to get a reply form a human and not the automat robot it went along Your case has been forwarded to Jason listened Jason really listened and bothered to do all the calling and fighting on my behalf Jason relieved me from anxiety just by being empathetic fully professional and going the extra mile The hotel had absolutely nothing to do with my lost luggage but during the check out Jason even hired a cab for me to catch my express to the airport I was going to take a bus or tube to the station And it was even prepaid So yes for me Jason Harris represents not only the excellent quality of service of DoubleTree by Hilton but their genuine care for guests And my feeling is Jason was not an exception I could feel the extra care from other staff as well mainly in the Caf during the breakfast It s just that Jason exceeded all of my expectations 2 The unbelievably delicious warm chocolate cookies they give you at the reception I even took some for my mom back to my hometown ,0,231,1
 The thing that stands out the most about this hotel is how unique it is the styling decorations the rooftop bar the amenities were all very clever and well designed For the rooftop bar I really enjoyed the fancy drinks and the antiques scattered around it gave something for you to walk around and look at other than the amazing view I really enjoyed the bikes as well for 10 euro you can get a bike to ride for the whole day Surprisingly the bikes were actually very nice belt drive single speeds that were fast and light I actually got great exercise on them along the canal and also explored a decent amount of the city I also enjoyed the shop and fun free postcards they give you they are nothing special but a nice touch I never tried the restaurant but if the food was as good and as reasonably priced as the drinks at the rooftop bar then I am sure it is good For location I think it is good if you want to see the museums and not be too close to the main downtown It is a bit of a hike to get to the majority of bars and attractions near the canal but it is no problem if you are energetic or take the public transport Would go back for sure ,0,230,1

 During our Europe holiday we rated our stay at Ohla Eixample as the best that we had and we had stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels Upon arrival we received a fantastic welcome and a lovely glass of bubbles and during our stay were treated as a VIP guest at all times The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable with modern touches and layout and everything was explained very well by the polite young man who accompanied us up to our room with our bags We had a great sleep since the bed was comfy and the room was quiet with no outside noise filtering in At breakfast we were pleasantly surprised and impressed by the hotel gifting a book and a red rose to all guests in celebration of Sant Jordi s day Such a lovely gesture by the hotel and my rose was still going strong over a week later The staff really were the highlight of our stay and went above and beyond to make it a most enjoyable one for us They were very helpful with a smile at all times and we appreciated all they did for us We wished we could have stayed on longer and wouldn t hesitate to stay here again We certainly hope to do that again soon Many thanks to all Ohla Eixample staff ,0,228,1
 The hotel is 30 second walk from Dam square All attractions and museums are walking within distance The hotel staff are very friendly and the rooms are clean Loved our stay at the hotel even though Swissotel had a technical glitch on their system which meant our first nights booking didn t go through and the hotel was fully booked for that night I arrived very late at the hotel after a late flight around 11 30 pm at which point the staff informed me about the technical error Swissotel swiftly dealt with the matter before my arrival and had arranged for myself and my husband to stay at the Hilton double tree for the night Swissotel arranged for our taxi to Hilton and back from the Hilton the next day and even included breakfast at the Hilton Upon arrival back at Swissotel the next day we were upgraded to a junior suite and a bottle of champagne sent to our room The staff were so friendly and couldn t apologies enough The technical glitch was a blessing in disguise The house keeping staff were also very friendly Our room was cleaned twice a day with two lovely ladies every evening coming round with a chocolate for each guest and a weather update for the next day Thank you Swissotel our stay has been great ,0,227,1
 Location Location of the Hotel is excellent in Inner City and walking distance to all the main attractions like St Stephens Cathedral Spanish Riding School Hofberg Palace Etc Commuting is very comfortable to and from the hotel as the main Tram Station of Schedenplatz is across the road The Schwedenplatz Metro station is 50 metres from the Hotel from where all the main metro lines connect to all the parts of Vienna Rooms Rooms were very comfortable with a balcony that opened on the side street which was very quiet Rooms were clean and Air conditioning was effective The best thing about the room was that a Samsung Tablet was provided for free which helped in surfing about the main attractions of the City and tourist activities BREAKFAST Breakfast was excellent with very wide array of servings of eggs bacons sausages fruits good chocolate Croissants and very good Cakes Staff at breakfast was very good and took special care to the needs and requirements of the guests SERVICE Service was excellent and Staff very helpful to take care of the guests The front desk helped us with the bookings of concert online and suggested good concert Also the train bookings to Budapest was also done by the front desk staff after knowing from us our requirements Overall an excellent stay Would Love to visit again ,0,227,1
 Every member of hotel staff was friendly chatty and comfortable From check in the friendly conversation began which made us feel welcome Miguel showed us to our room and was polite helpful and told us a little about the hotel which is always nice We had a fantastic room with an amazing view room 616 The hotel even put out a little plate of dessert treats with a happy birthday message for my partner which was lovely Room was spacious and well decorated with a comfortable bed which gave us a great nights sleep Room was also quiet enough in the night although I m unsure if that was to do with being up on the 6th floor Location was brilliant Right next to hoxton square and shoreditch high street Bar in the hotel was well decorated with very friendly staff Roberto especially was a superb cocktail maker and made some very good long islands for us in the evening Impressed with the quirkiness of the bar but feel that not enough people know about it yet so the atmosphere was a little lacking However this will pick up in time I am sure Roberto and Roberta looked after us in the bar and we felt very comfortable chatting away to them All in all impressed with our stay and will definately come again ,0,226,1
 It was just the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in from start to finish On arrival we were greeted by the ever so welcoming gentleman with a beard who my husband said several times just could not do enough We received some very lovely treats for the kiddies which made them feel very special Our room was split level which generously provided excellent accommodation for us a family of five We totally adored the decor in the breakfast room it was so trendy and the lovely lady there assisted kindly in helping make a wonderful coffee The staff were so pleasant The location is just so so so so excellent when visiting Barcelona We had a window overlooking the little street just off la rambla and we were directly across the street from the busiest market in Barcelona which was pure class My husband needed to book accommodation for the following night and a few other bits and bobs before our departure and the girls on reception was most helpful Wonderful to meet such nice staff in such a busy city It was the best location for shopping site seeing strolling down la Rambla etc We just loved it and will be back If only it had been the 1st of July and all the sales would have started Overall 10 10 well Excellllleeeennnnttttttt,0,226,1
 Wonderful staff very courteous and attentive We missed breakfast on the first morning and the staff brought us coffee croissants in the lounge Hotel only 2 min walk from Gare de Lyon which is only a 15 min train journey from Gare de Nord very handy when travelling by Eurostar to Paris Although located in a busy area the hotel is very quiet and no street noise hence we slept late on the first morning Our room was at the rear of the hotel on 4th floor hotel lift was really fast too Our room had recently been renovated to a very high standard and was beautiful Huge bed with luxurious pristine bed linen new bathroom with fabulous new modern shower Although renovated they have kept many original architectural features of the hotel and enhanced its overall appearance and it is a stunning mix of old new We highly recommend a nearby restaurant called A la biche au Bois A small friendly welcoming restaurant with a wonderful vibe food is fresh home cooked Coq au Vin is a house specialty Frequented mainly by Parisiens so you know it s good We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to others I don t usually do reviews so this is an honest review of a hotel which delivered more than we expected ,0,224,1
 I loved every single thing about my stay here Having previously stayed in different Waldorf Astoria s around the world including New York I genuinely feel this is by far my favourite My room was absolutely divine staying in the deluxe room right on the river with my partner I was only sheduled to stay here for 2 nights but I fell so in love with the room city and staff that I extended my stay an extra 3 nights Absolutely obsessed with the shower in my room So perfect and actually heart broken that I have to leave it Room is sooo spacious bed is amazing giving you a perfect sleep and they even have their own pillow menu for that extra comfort as if you need it Staff I cannot applaud them enough Genuinely care and go the extra mile for you I would like to make special compliments to the reception concierge Lizanne not sure on the spelling exceptional customer service skills and really really cared about mine and my partners upmost comfort during our stay and ran all over the building at all hours of the night for us One last thing the building and the architecture of this building is incredible An amazing historic building with a beautiful characteristic luxury interior design Cannot reccomend this hotel enough ,0,224,1
 The hotel is clean nice and cozy The people were very nice especially a young romanian lady she helped us very much by giving us accurate transport directions The cleaning was made daily also the towels changed every day Flatscreen tv A small fridge empty no unsolicited beverages The bathroom clean quite big Also the room was big The matresses were confortable but the our double room had 2 single beds put together insted of one double The breakfast had many items good quality It consisted of the classic items ham cheese salami eggs tomatoes cucumbers fruit cereal jam honey juices different pastries etc but also fruit salads fruit yoghurt pancakes one day apfelstrudel some days even vegetable soup which we did not try We had a room facing the street and not on the railway so it was also quiet The location is not extraordinary but also not bad Near Schonbrunn You also have one Hofer market near same type as Lidl and a Billa You have a tram near the entrance of the hotel metro station not far approx 15 min walk I guess but you may need an hour to get in center especially in the evening All in all very good price quality ratio would definitely recommend for the price you pay in Vienna you get super value ,0,224,1
 We had a lovely stay at the Golden Tulip from the moment we checked in until the moment we left The hotel is comfortable and stylish and I cannot fault it at all We had 2 lovely rooms next door to each other the d cor was really nice and the rooms clean We loved the Nespresso coffee machines and complimentary toiletries and the TV had lots of channels Also a British plug socket in each room is very thoughtful The free Wi Fi was fabulous and it was great that you didn t have to keep logging in I was able to print my boarding passes in the lounge on the free computer and printer facility The lounge and business area downstairs was lovely and always very calm The bar had warm friendly staff and was a pleasure to use We didn t need to trouble the reception staff much as everything we needed was provided for anyway but we did purchase daily tram tickets which was very handy Staff also provided us with a map and tram directions the hotel is ideally situated a little out of town but just a short tram ride away and is conveniently located for Sloterdjike train station If I am ever fortunate enough to visit Amsterdam why would I choose to stay anywhere else ,0,224,1
 It was my birthday and immediately on learning this the Receptionist upgraded my room I was also given a complimentary birthday gift which was such a wonderful surprise I nearly cried As I was alone it was so kind of the staff to make a fuss of me and I can t thank them enough All the staff are so helpful and have a relaxed manner but remain exceptionally polite My room was fabulous pure white with nothing out of place and nothing but that which was elegant such as the main lights At night the lighting could be used to paint your choice from the delectable range of colours at your fingertips I have stayed in my room all day The hotel interior is beautiful very spacious modern and light The furniture and art work are modern with a sense of humour and are my favourite style of decoration Best use is made of lighting for colour effect and a purity of space is achieved by the ethereal whiteness of the high walls I simply LOVE it It is within walking distance of the Coliseum for the English National Opera I am disabled and even I could manage the walk Room service is friendly and helpful and the choice of dining is amazing I can t wait to go back ,0,223,1
 The Sumner is in a great location Marylebone neighborhood near Hyde Park and Oxford Street I stayed here for a 7 days and was able to get around without any issues the Marble Arch Underground station is a 5 minute walk away There are also plenty of restaurants nearby as well The hotel itself is cozy and quaint and you ll literally wake up to the smell of bacon from the breakfast room downstairs with a good selection to start your day and super friendly staff The room isn t huge but has plenty of space for solo travelers or couples I stayed on the third floor at the rear of the building and the noise level outside and within the hotel was practically non existent after 9pm so you ll absolutely get the sleep you need The bathroom has all the amenities you d expect and the shower is one of the best I ve used in Europe so far Only small downside was no iron ironing board provided in the room I also have to mention that the hotel staff is exceptional in their service I had a minor dispute on my check out folio and they gladly corrected the issue while being back in the states I highly recommend this hotel for any first time travelers to London ,0,223,1
 We were a family of 4 oneself husband 9year old daughter my young mother As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted with friendly faces a spotless reception with a great vibe The check in was very simple We used the self check in which was straight forward easy to operate The rooms where very comfortable clean All members of our party were very happy Cleaned every day Bonus to have a coffee machine vending machine in room vending machine reasonably priced coffee top ups available at your request The breakfast was really pleasant It may seem expensive but if you were to dine out elsewhere you ll pay more as we discovered Lots of variety The staff where straight there to clear plates keep areas topped up with fresh food thank you The tram stop No2 is right outside hotel Straight forward to get to all the sights It was nice to be in around all the action during the day in a quieter location at night Several places around at night for food should you wish to dine out of the hotel I d recommend this hotel to my friends family Would stay here without hesitation if I visited Amsterdam again Thank you to all the staff especially those who kept it spotless throughout our stay x,0,223,1
 We had a wonderful stay in Hotel das Tyrol mind you the entrance is not on the Mariahilferstrasse 15 but just before the corner in the small side street called Konigs Klostergasse The very high ratings for this hotel are very deserved indeed It really is a very nice hotel with wonderful art inside at every floor The double room was great with a view over the roofs at the back of the hotel on the 4th floor I guess all rooms are very nice but I would probably favour those at the back 15 25 35 45 55 or 65 Breakfast was very good and besides all kinds of things you can order a hot breakfast too It s location is very central close to the main musea the opera house and a bit further the Belvedere The staff are just exemplary they did their utmost in advising us were we might find some of the very nice porcelain art displayed all over the hotel We also took the opportunity to relax in the sauna steam room downstairs which we had to ourselves see the really beautiful and perfectly kept sea aquarium We will most certainly be back as two nights the most of three days is really to short to visit Vienna Thanks to all the wonderful staff ,0,222,1
 This hotel was really nice i stayed here for 2 nights on the 14th Nov 15 It has a very contemporary touch and was super clean I stayed in room 121 which was a triple room It was perfect for 3 adults Bathroom was clean and modern too with the usually shower gels and creams etc fresh clean towels available daily and rooms cleaned daily Hair dryer iron and ironing board in rooms Good sized wardrobe with hangers Plus desk and chair Small fridge and safe in rooms too large flat screen TV on wall with Sky TV available Excellent wifi no password required and Free parking front and rear full English Breakfast inc the usual sausages beans hash browns mushrooms tomatoes cereals pastries pots of tea coffee and a variety of juices fruit also available Restaurant was very clean and staff very professional If you have any issues management are very quick to resolve these in a courteous manner Large Tescos 5 mins drive way The location was perfect for where we needed to go it s ideal especially if u are driving The price was excellent for a London based hotel Oh forgot to say it also has a small but useful gym Thanks to all the staff for a lovely stay Hope to see u again soon,0,221,1
 A wonderful gem of a hotel in the perfect location for us Staff was friendly and ever so helpful Room was very generous by Parisan standards and very up to date in all ways chic but with all the American appointments fridge hairdryer free WiFi Was worried at first that it was too far from the heart of the Latin District but it turned out to be even better It s a Block from the Pantheon and a couple blocks from Luxembourg Gardens A 5 minute walk down St Michel to the flurry of the Latin District but no noise at night to contend with We used the Open Tour hop on hop off bus recommended by the staff stop at Lux Gardens to get further away for some touristy stuff and just to enjoy the other Arrondisemonts sp Used rer to get from the airport and back 10 Euro pp and the Lux Garden stop was so close While we didn t partake of the 15 Euro pp breakfast it was an rather impressive spread far beyond a continental breakfast They were very gracious and comped me a cup of coffee on 2 mornings when that s all I needed Highly recommend this hotel and at 650 Euro for 3 nights it would be hard to beat ,0,220,1
 The Rosewood is a beautiful hotel with all the facilities you could hope for and more The staff are outstanding what a wonderful warm welcome they gave me and literally they can not do enough for you The attention to detail to our reservation was absolutely stunning I had a wonderful lady called Sophia check me in and I must say what a welcome I was given The staff even took into account my guest arriving later than myself and made sure her every need was attended to We were celebrating a birthday and my my didnt they ensure we celebrated in style My guest arrived to a beautifully made cake by their very own pasty chef and a hand written note from the hotel manager She was completely overwhelmed This hotel their staff the beautiful spacious rooms and huge comfy beds set in an amazing location really is not one to be missed If you do stay here make sure to spend some time in their bar Saturday evening there was a stunning Jazz band on and wow what a night I really cant rate this hotel and their amazing customer service high enough Thank you for having me and I will be sure to recommend this hotel to friends family and clients in the future ,0,219,1
 Enjoyed everything My room was quiet nice and clean I have also appreciated the water boiler the Nespresso machine and the three coffee capsules and two tea bags per day Breakfast is of good quality and variety The swimming pool is about 12 meters long It is very good for a hotel pool if you like swimming a bit Water temperature was very good too The hotel is not in the centre This can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the case An advantage is that you are not in the middle of the main touristic routes with the associated chaos A disadvantage is that there are not many restaurants at walking distance beyond the hotel restaurant which is however not bad although selection is quite limited Anyway the restaurants available in the neighbourhood are not exclusively targeted to tourists and this is a pro for me Walking to the Damrak is about 40 min Tram stop to from the centre is about 5 min walking With a tram you can reach the Damrak in around 15 20 min The hotel is at 1Km so at walking distance from the Amsterdam Lelylaan train station which you can easily reach from to the Schiphol airport Journey from to the airport is very short around 10 min ,0,219,1
 Free Spa Sauna VIP Lounge free for Booking com was excellent VIP Lounge also had comfortable seatings on the terrace with excellent views Location is brilliant since it is on L4 Metro that took us to the heart of Barcelona for only 1 in 15 minutes amazing Metro station only 3 minutes walk away A big shopping centre good bakery restaurants the beech almost right opposite Staff were very warm helpful polite and friendly Special thanks to receptionist Ms Marta Luna Mng Mr Aitor Ruta Considering we spent a week in Arts Hotel we did not miss much The room was equipped with a desk and all sorts of sockets Perfect for a business trip too Good place to hold business meetings as well as quality time with the family Airport journey costed only 4 50 by Metro one hour 15 minutes There are various Travel cards available but we bought T10 for 9 50 T10 could be used for 10 journeys Same card could be used by more than one individuals Each use will be considered a journey If 2 persons are using the same card then they can use for 5 journeys 5x2 10 Card T50 is a lot cheaper allows 50 journeys perfect for a family or a group of friends Hope this helps ,0,219,1
 A great hotel with nice and friendly staff Very clean The room has airco heater built in It is 10 minutes walking from Webstbannhoff metro train station which has a huge shopping mall with all the stuff you would need Just upon arrival remember to tell the reception you would like to opt out from 2 things 1 Hotel breakfast it costs 22 euro and is absolutely unnecessary There is a Subway Sandwich in front of the hotel and a nice cheap super market Billa at the corner of the street where you can buy anything you need for a full breakfast much much cheaper Tell the reception you will not need breakfast from the hotel 2 Mini bar in the room Mini bar in the room is a small fridge and the reception asks for a 40 euro deposit in case you consume anything from mini bar during your stay But a bottle of water in the mini bar costs around 4 euro It s pretty expensive and unnecessary Tell the reception you will not consume anything from mini bar and keep it so Buy your own drinks from the supermarket at the corner Billa and keep them cold inside the mini bar You won t need to pay anything for using the mini bar ,0,218,1
 Hotel was very easy to find On arrival staff were very helpful It s obvious that this hotel had recently undergone some major renovation The bar is not yet finished but that did not detract from our enjoyment of the hotel Breakfast was continental and a good variety of offerings toast cheese cold meats salami fresh fruit croissants and other pastries various cereals and also a gluten free option For 4 95 extra one could have a full English breakfast which although I did not have this option looked very good The bed has to be the largest bed I have ever seen it s HUGE and very comfy Bus stops are just a few metres from the hotel and are easy to understand For 1 50 the number 23 bus will take you into London city centre Great eating places to be found near the hotel and very cheap Once checked out we were able to leave our bags and collect them later on in the day prior to going for our train home I cannot praise this hotel enough Although some may consider it a bit far from the tourist attractions I say give it a go you won t be disappointed it s only a 10 minute bus ride away from Oxford Circus,0,217,1
 The staff in the hotel were great Lots of helpful advice for my sons who were going to a concert the reason for our brief visit to Barcelona The restaurant staff were also very accommodating when we wanted food both in the little courtyard and later when we ordered room service The rooms were a little small tho perfectly good for me as I was in a single My sons were in a bigger room My room had a balcony overlooking the street but traffic noises weren t too bad at all The bathroom had a shower preferable to a bath I always feel The tiles in the bathroom are gorgeous and take bathroom use to a different level delightful We had breakfast in a restaurant a few steps from the hotel great staff fun vibe good food The public spaces are welcoming and generous with sofas chairs tables aplenty and very comfortable The little patio at the back is sweet and good for coffees or meals Our flight was not til later in the afternoon and the staff were happy to keep our luggage safely tucked away til our departure I m so happy I chose this hotel as it is also right in the heart of everywhere one wants to go in Barcelona ,0,217,1
 We had stayed my wife and I at Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth over thirty years ago We liked it very much then The hotel exudes old world charm some find it old fashioned It is centrally located in the Inner City a stone throw away from K rntner Strasse and Stephansdom This stay as with the first we had a comfy room in the back which made it very quiet The furniture is a collection of old fashioned bulky items The bathroom is not modern the sink miniscule It is a high climb to get into the bath tub something to do carefully and slowly if you don t want to hurt your back Overall the ambience remained the same as if stuck in the past old fashioned and rather stuffy Some of the staff is as old fashioned as the furniture A couple of the staff even became rather condescending when we decided not to have breakfast at the hotel One of the staff was nosy and initiated a chat about personal things At booking time the staff will nicely offer to buy you concert tickets it took several emails to make them admit they charge a fee Vienna is not cheap and this fact is well reflected in the high price at Kaiserin Elisabeth ,0,217,1
 We were upgraded to Room 509 which had great sea views Modern d cor and furnishings Room compact but perfectly formed and functional Ensuite was large and modern Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and went beyond the call of duty especially on our arrival Who could say no to one of their delicious warm cookies which were generously offered on arrival We didn t and in fact we asked for more over our stay and staff were more than happy to provide The location of the hotel was about a 10 15 minute free ferry ride away from Amsterdam Central Station with frequent crossings until late at night The hotel is very close to the ferry stand and located in a somewhat industrial unpolished area Despite the area not being particularly picturesque it did have a certain port charm of its own and had more than enough dining venues and options nearby if you didn t want to head over to main Amsterdam We chose DTbH NDSM Wharf primarily on price and feel we definitely received value for money Thanks to the extraordinary staff who made us feel special and comfortable all at the same time A credit to Dutch hospitality We really appreciated it Keep up the good work A Burton Australia ,0,216,1
 My partner and myself had checked into another hotel just down the road from Doubletree and it was awful it was cramped the bathroom was tiny and the toilet wouldn t flush The walls were so paper thin you could hear people talking in the next room as if there was no wall there at all As it was obvious we weren t going to be able to get any sleep there we went online and reserved a room at the Doubletree We had been there less than 30 minutes but they wouldn t refund any of the 360 We had paid So by the time we reached the Doubletree we were very stressed out and upset but the staff at Doubletree were very welcoming and friendly and the cookies we got when we checked in were lovely Breakfast was delicious and set us up for each day sightseeing around London There was no noise from neighbouring rooms the only sound you could hear was the occasional door slamming The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Prince Regent DLR station for connections to the underground You can also take the cable cars across to the 02 arena The hotel had beautiful views of the river and we would definitely stay here again ,0,215,1
 The staff was phenomenal They were all incredibly helpful I didn t get the name of the man who helped me when I checked in but he was very kind and friendly I arrived on my own with my daughter due to join me later on Saturday evening Unfortunately her flight was delayed 7 hours which caused her to miss her connecting flight in Copenhagen so she didn t arrive in Paris until Sunday The staff took pity on us since she missed one of her two nights in Paris and upgraded us to a rooftop room with an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower So I enjoyed the wonderful view the first night and we both loved it for the second night There is also a rooftop bar and restaurant with a similar view The breakfast was very substantial It wasn t included in the room rate that we arranged but it can be part of a package It was worth the cost There was a fairly new staff member by the name of Pierre Antoine who was incredibly helpful with directions and I m directionally challenged with suggestions for dining etc The hotel was very modern sleek and clean We loved our stay at Terrass and would definitely recommend it ,0,214,1
 Fabulous hotel nothing was too much trouble the staff were so helpful The room was modern everything was controlled remotely even the curtains It was clean and very spacious for London Fresh coffee available in the rooms quality bath robes and toiletries everything you needed and more Having arrived too early to check in we left our bags with the concierge before going off for the day to see a show Old Street tube station is literally a one minute walk from the front door On return we were greeted by name and advised everything was ready for us and that our luggage was in the room waiting We enjoyed great cocktails during happy hour before going out for the evening There are great local restaurants all within walking distance from the hotel we ate at 100 Hoxton Breakfast the following morning was good quality with plenty of choice We looked out from the 16th floor over the sights of London and St Pauls Cathedral It was a relaxed affair there was no rush for us to eat and get out I would say this hotel is great value for money and would highly recommend if you want somewhere special to stay in London I really look forward to staying again ,0,213,1
 I stayed here with a friend in early July We chose the hotel because of the building the design and good reviews The hotel is the right side of funky By that I mean the design is funky without being impractical Although the hotel is on Clerkenwell Road the area is quiet and I had a good night s sleep Within easy reach of Oxford Street on the 55 bus All the staff were very friendly from reception to the housekeeper cleaning my room Special mention should go to Fabian on reception who sorted out a problem with the reservation via booking com and Olga who served breakfast with a smile The hotel has a map of Clerkenwell with recommendations for bars and restaurants We tried Sosharu a Japanese restaurant that was expensive but excellent and St John which does traditional British food also very good Clerkenwell itself is an interesting area with many old industrial buildings Worth exploring is the nearby Museum of the Order of St John St John s Ambulance housed in the former entrance to the Priory of St John We also walked to Islington and looked around the Regent s Canal A very enjoyable stay and nice to discover a new part of London Highly recommended ,0,213,1
 Absolutely lovely hotel We arrived a few hours before check in we were greeted by smiley friendly staff who went over and above for us moved us to another room so we could check in earlier after our drive Breakfast was just awesome I m not one for breakfast but there is so much to choose from from cooked food to pastries meats fruits chocolate fountains champagne the selection was perfect The rooms are lovely we had a sea view room which I highly recommend you ask for when booking Also in the lobby make sure you check out Enjoy Electrics car tours the price is VERY good we went on the panoramic tour for 3 hours 2 of us in a mini convertible car for just 70 euros this is an AMAZING way to see more of Barcelona Paolo the guide who will take you round is fantastic such a kind and friendly man he really made the tour special Make sure you also try some of the house cocktails my fav was Red Passion fabulous drink All in all the hotel was amazing the staff were great we couldn t have had a better holiday that we got engaged on Barcelona holds a special spot in our hearts now ,0,213,1
 The hotel was perfectly situated a train and metro ride away from the airport and the staff couldn t do enough the help We had an amazing time in Amsterdam and will be returning to this hotel on our next trip Any one going be advised to take good comfortable walking shoes The hotel is a nice little walk away from the main strip of this part of the city The river views are beautiful which ever way you look and the local shops are staffed by laid back friendly people Take the metro two stops up towards the city centre and take a walk through waterlooplien as this area is beautiful and has the zoo botanicals gardens and the historic flea market with Waterloo square being surrounded by coffeeshops gift shops restaurants and the canals Find a supermarket and make yourself a picnic be warned though they can be hard to come by and open at different times to we English are used to The room we stayed it was comfortable and clean a very trendy hipster location for students and travellers Would recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone oooo and go and find TAPMARIN an 800m stroll from the hotel and the best burger you will ever have ,0,213,1
 This hotel is full of character and the staff are very helpful and friendly They were always smiling and were most willing to give any advice or assistance that we needed The breakfasts were delicious with a really good choice of high quality food We also enjoyed our evening meals in the traditional Wiener Wirtschaft restaurant also part of the hotel Service there was very efficient and good humoured Our room was warm and clean and the beds were very comfortable Tea and coffee facilities were provided as well as bathroom toiletries and free use of a room safe for extra security The hotel is well situated to allow guests to use Vienna s excellent public transport system trams go past hotel every 5 minutes and underground is only a few hundred yards away both are extremely convenient and very reliable You can get to virtually any part of the city within minutes we bought a weekly travel pass for the equivalent of 11 50 each and have to say it was definitely well worth it Having said that it is only a few minutes easy walk to the main museums galleries and palaces This is our second visit to this hotel and we wouldn t dream of staying anywhere else ,0,213,1
 Incredible staff perfect location great service I was traveling with my wife and five year old daughter It was my first time in Paris and so delighted to say that we had a fabulous experience with the hotel From the beginning and check in they did everything in their power to make sure we re getting the best service There was a confusion with our reservation at booking com and they upgraded us to a better room free of charge for the first night and for the remaining nights we have been offered two connecting rooms which were really spacious clean and fully equipped and they gave us a good discount on that room It was my birthday and they treated us with complimentary drinks at the bar All the girls at the reception Eva and her colleagues whose name unfortunately I don t remember were super supportive and kind They gave us great recommendations on choice of restaurants places to go nearby checking our flight and At the checkout We left my daughter s jacket at the hotel and they emailed us and promised to keep at a safe place until someone comes and get it There was nothing wrong with the hotel and we will definitely go back ,0,212,1
 Stayed for 2 nights while running around London 5 minute walk to the station and easy access to all of London from there Emirates cable car experience system is close by and you can even take a stroll there along the lake front The hotel booked me in early 11am to be exact as they had rooms open even if rooms are not open yet they have an excellent luggage storing facility even once i had checked out the looked after my bags till it was time to go to the airport Great friendly staff that were very helpful and super efficient the staff greet you and make you feel at home The breakfast was a super range and variety making sure you did not go hungry Even Dinner at the hotel was excellent have a great menu and decent prices The rooms are spacious and clean with good aircon systems so even with the heat wave in London the room was cool and comfy a large TV and good shower make it a home away from home Even though you are only a short distance from the London City Airport you can not hear the plane taking off from the rooms super quiet Will definitely be staying there again ,0,212,1
 You become awestruck when you see this hotel It s beautiful It has an old school charm mixed with contemporary styling and the mix is so good that you fall in love with it The location is good It is opposite to the Milan Central Train Station Duomo is Easily accessible by a taxi The hotel staff is so courteous At par with any leading hotel of the world Full marks to the staff Our room was big airy and beautiful It had a gallery To open the door and enter the outside gallery area the hotel staff will ask you to sign a declaration No fuss about it Just sign it and the guy will come with a key to open the door Simple Clean rooms with a mini bar electric kettle and multiple ports for charging Breakfast takes place on the ground floor and they have a plethora of choices Not good for vegetarians as they have only fruits and desserts for them The Maserati given by the hotel for their guests is a nice touch We enjoyed the drive thoroughly Slightly on the expensive side but when in Milan do dedicate a few days from your trip and stay in the lap of luxury Highly recommended ,0,211,1
 I chose this hotel because of the reasonable price on booking com I wanted the convenience of the city but didn t really care about being in a luxury hotel WOW It was very grand and luxurious The location was amazing I wouldn t have asked to be any closer to Placa Catalunya and the conveniences of the city When I had a problem in my room the first night water dripping from shower above and toilet running when upstairs toilet was flushed the night manager was extremely helpful and apologetic Nothing could be done at that moment due to the time of day and full bookings but the following morning they moved me to a luxurious suite on the 8th floor with a beautiful corner balcolny overlooking the city and mountains They went above an beyond to ensure I was taken care of As a single female traveler I never felt I was unsafe The amount of staff in the lobby and the key system meant that someone was always aware of my departure and return English was spoken fairly well by the front staff The roof top pool and bar loungers and view were truly amazing I honestly have NOTHING negative to say about my stay ,0,210,1
 The hotel more than met our requirements for our 1 night stay We had booked a deluxe triple deluxe double room for our family of 5 As it states in the blurb the rooms are described as compact and our double was just that but we did not find this an issue and found the room to be comfortable modern and clean The bathroom looked new with modern fittings a lovely shower with an adjustable wall mounted head rainfall overhead fitting We also had ample tea coffee supplies bottled water biscuits and a selection of fresh fruit The reception and public rooms have been tastefully restored and give the hotel real character All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful Finally the location is a real bonus as there are 2 tube stops within 2 minutes walk Hyde Park is just across the road and there are numerous bus stops However if you don t mind a walk then the West End is about 25 minutes way on foot We also had a lovely surprise when we checked in as instead of the triple room we had booked we had been upgraded to the Lily Langtry suite which made our stay that extra bit special ,0,209,1
 We had an excellent stay at this hotel It is located in the theater district quite near many plays and dozens of restaurants on the Seven Dials round about which was all decorated beautifully for Christmas It is also a 15 minute walk from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery It is a great location for New Year s Eve as well as the hotel is a 20 minute walk from the best place to see the fireworks The streets directly around the hotel are small so there is no traffic or city noise However taxis come through regularly so it only takes a minute or two to get a taxi The rooms are a reasonable size and comfortable We had 3 rooms two had a large shower one had a shower tub The customer service is top rate We had a problem with one room and they immediately moved us to a bigger room for the same price Furthermore room service arrived in under 5 minutes from when we called for ice or more towels And they have complimentary candy and apples in the lobby every day The Internet was free and adequate Our rate included breakfast which was a good deal ,0,209,1
 I spent three nights in Hyatt Regency with my two 11 years old kids We had a club room on 32nd floor which was upgraded to a room with Eiffel tower view The view was fantastic The kids were amazed I couldn t take them away from the window We had an access to the Regency club on the 30th floor offering different food and drinks throughout the day It was really convenient for the pauses we were making after the hours spent visiting sites in Paris The breakfast was also served in the club for the club room guests The hotel takes you directly to a metro station through the shopping mall from 8 am to 8 pm in the evenings you should use the street access I see a lot are complaining about the price of the rooms and the hotel bar and restaurant but it was just an average cost of service you get in Paris the accommodation and food is extremely expensive everywhere in Paris We were warned by the staff about the potential noice by the ongoing reconstruction works in the hotel but we didn t hear anything I would certainly stay here again particularly after the renovation is finished next year ,0,209,1
 I thought the hotel was beautiful The bar and seating area is lovely They ve really made use of all the space First impressions were really good when we were greeted with a lovely member of staff to check us in It is a business hotel but they have 5 floors of rooms which are out to the public privileged rooms as they call it The room was lovely was a little small but there was only 2 of us so wasn t a problem Cleanliness was good We stayed for 3 nights and they tidied our room every day We had a really good shower it gave us an option to have the water head as normal and we also had a shower that was on the ceiling too which wasn t ideal for a woman when they don t want to wash their hair hehe But was still good because I could just swap the option and use the other shower We didn t go for the break fast but I m sure we wouldn t have been dissappointed Over all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to anyone Business or couples Definitely live the life of luxury in this hotel 10 10,0,209,1
 Location is a little far out but we knew this when booking so it didn t bother us If you re not too fussed about being central it s actually really easy to get to and from the city centre with good transport links and an added bonus of being able to rent out bikes or a scooter a really good way of seeing the real Amsterdam not just the touristy parts and giving you the freedom get around easily we got a Vespa for the day and absolutely loved it The hotel itself is lovely well equipped with friendly and accommodating staff on call at the 24hr reception there s a restaurant too we never used it but have no doubt it would be amazing sitting out having a meal on the patio when the weathers nice We spent each day of our stay out on the grounds smoking and having a drink of our own bought at the supermarket about 15 mins away such a relaxing environment to wake up to and unwind in I could speak endlessly on how much we enjoyed our stay we got so much for what we paid a trip back here before the year s out is almost certain ,0,209,1
 We stayed at the hotel for two nights and the room is spacious comfortable and very clean The staff is helpful at check in and kindly helps us arrange a late check out on the day we are to leave as well as offer to book us a taxi to the airport The location of the hotel is also excellent It s a short walk from two underground stations There is a very nice playground near one of the stations as well as supermarkets so it s ideal for the family with small kids like ours Moreover there are a few restaurants within the walking distance We tried two restaurants as per the suggestion of the hotel staff and found that both places serve very good food Though not far from the city centre the neighbourhood of the hotel is quiet and safe What s most impressive at the hotel has to be the breakfast buffet The variety and quality of food provided is even better than some five star hotel we stayed The food is nicely cooked fresh and very delicious There s also a range of gluten free and dairy free food you can choose from which I think is very considerate of the hotel ,0,209,1
 My wife and I are traveling all over italy 46 days total staying in 18 locations While in Capri I had a nasty fall resulting in several stitches in my elbow so When I arrived in Milan at the Excelsior Hotel I was hurting and had to find a place to remove my stitches so I asked for the help of a young man named Filipo at the Excelsior front desk he said this request was unusual and it was the day before Easter a serious Italy Holiday as the Hospital was closed He asked if he could do his homework and call my room in 10 minutes He called as he said he delivered written details to me He had every detail arranged I was in and out of the hospital emergency care ward in 15 minutes thanks to Filipo Thank God for him That night we had a wonderful meal at the main dining room and over our next 4 day stay there the Hotel worked out perfectly as we had hoped It was so close to the central train station we were in and out of trains and subways several times per day our stay there could not have been better thank you Excelsior ,0,209,1
 Booked a 2 night break for us and our friends throughly enjoyed our stay My friends room was very large as was my sons ours was a lot smaller but very comfortable We had booked a royal afternoon tea for when we arrived the staff made us feel very welcome and the food especially the cakes was exactly what we expected from a hotel of this standard We visited a few London pubs on the first night there literally are a fair few of them around each corner probably due to the proximity of the barracks then ended up trying some of the special gins that the cocktail waiters recommended back at our home from home Our breakfast on both mornings were fabulous with plenty of choice inc a taste of India This hotel is literally next door to Buckingham palace The only thing we missed was having a swim after being tourists on the second day they have a sauna steam room but they are seperated into men ladies sides and my friend had a migraine on the Saturday afternoon so while the chaps all had a nice steam room chat together I was on my own in the female facility the only minor negative ,0,208,1
 The staff is incredible and the location is everything You re steps away from the literal heart of Paris The area is very safe during the night as well I had no issue walking from the Tower to the hotel after midnight Ordered room service twice food was excellent and portions were very large My room had a nice view of the streets below and even though it wasn t a walk out balcony you could still sit on it a bit The only issue I had were in some minor details I had some issues with the room phone one of my lights didn t work and the tub wouldn t fill However I was out a majority of the day so I didn t really care The other issue i had was room services letting a door slam repeatedly while cleaning the room next to mine at 9am I actually had to get out of bed to tell them to stop so I could sleep it promptly subsided Taxi service is quick and easy and bike rentals are legit right outside of the hotel doors Tons of restaurants near by The bed will suck you in tons of fluffy pillows and soft bedding ,0,207,1

 The location of the Hotel is excellent Just a 5 minute walk from the central station Metro entrances are also just outside the hotel from where one can travel on the green and yellow lines The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful which made a lot of difference as this was my first trip to Italy I was on the 7th floor and my room had an excellent view The room the bathroom bedsheets pillow covers and towels were very neat and clean and there was no smell The breakfast was also very nice My omelet was served with very nice and fresh green vegetables on the side every day My flight was at 9 20 in the night and upon my request the hotel allowed me a late checkout till 4 00 in the afternoon which allowed a little time to relax and shop for gifts for my family There were just 3 minor hiccups along the way like my laundry was delayed the first 2 days my room was a little warm and one morning there was some problem with the hot water but all these problems were fixed without much stress so all in all it was a very good experience ,0,207,1
 The hotel is spotless clean situated in a good location near the Wembley Stadion The location is perfect for the events taking place at the Wembley Stadion and it provides good access to the tourist attractions from the center of London There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel which takes you to the Wembley Park tube stop 3 bus stops away from the hotel or a 10 15 minutes walk From the Wembley Park tube stop the center of London is easily reached via the Jubilee or the Metropolitan lines Both the room and the bathroom are very spacious modernly furnished and clean The room is equipped with touch sensitive buttons for light controlling do not disturb and room cleaning The staff is very friendly and helpful especially Ana and Bogdan who made sure all our requests were immediately acted upon and solved A special thanks to Ana for all the useful tips she provided us in regards to sightseeing means of transport surroundings of the hotel and for organizing a very appreciated surprise for my birthday which made our stay at this hotel even more pleasant For my next trip to London I will definitely book this hotel again ,0,206,1
 Great location and very nice comfortable family and couple hotel we had requested an early check in the hotel emailed us and told us that they will try their best arrived at the hotel by 9 30 am after a long and tiresome flight and found the hotel to be fully booked the reception staff asked us to wait a while and did indicate and apologise for the inconvenience as check in usual time in 2 00 pm By 11 00 am our room was ready to move into which was not very late as we only had to wait 1 and a half hour in the comfortable and well decorated lobby A complimentary tea or coffee for the waiting guests would have been nice and would have made us really appreciate the service from the hotel and would show that they really cared nonetheless the room was very clean and comfortable as well as the bathroom however while taking the shower the bath tub drain was closed and stuck so had to call the housekeeping and very promptly they came and fixed it in 5 minutes The breakfast was well served and up to the mark Would definitely come back and stay here ,0,206,1
 Although considered a business hotel this hotel certainly has a lot to offer in addition to its proximity to areas of interest and sightseeing opportunities The hotel is well appointed steps from Trafalgar Square on the left and a short 2 minute walk to the Thames if you head right While the hotel food can be considered expensive there are several good restaurant options including an Italian restaurant near Trafalgar Getting around the city is easy with Charring Cross station a minute away and many tour buses And if you have to spend time in the room rest assured that although the rooms are not large by American standards they are more than adequate with the bonus of free in room wifi and free bottled water Comfortable for single travelers If sharing consider that the bathroom counter space is lacking Although I didn t have an opportunity to meet Matthew who assisted me in booking I will say that he and all who were at the front desk were really welcoming including house keeping services who I had to arrange a ironing board and iron and who were prompt with delivery In all I would highly recommend this hotel for the overall experience ,0,205,1
 The Chiswick Rooms is one of those hotels that is essentially a B B without one of the Bs breakfast The rooms are small but it has to be said they are clean and quite modern There are no services at the hotel not even a vending machine which makes it just a place to sleep and wash There is nothing wrong with that and I have been to similar style hotels where the rooms are minute The one I stayed in is just about acceptable in terms of size The shower is one of those corner showers that serves a purpose but doesn t give a lot of room to manoeuvre The bed was comfortable enough a double but very very cosy for two It has a small room safe which is free to use and a fridge Also has air conditioning but it gurgled a lot and I m not sure how effective it was It is a good location with the tube nearby and plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance So if you just want somewhere to put your head for a night then this hotel is OK but no frills Good location and clean but pretty basic ,0,204,1
 The Westbridge hotel is absolutely the best we ve ever stayed The hotel is amazing gorgeous boutique look and super clean It is located 5 min by walk from Stratford center easy to reach and find The staff is very friendly polite and willing to help you with whatever you need Check in was quick and we got room 207 big enough for two people modern super clean and very quiet Big comfy bed for a good quality sleep smart TV smart phone mini fridge electric kettle with tea and coffee safe There is everything you need Bathroom is really nice and also super clean hairdryer toiletries weight scale and magnifying mirror are provided Towels are very big and fluffy If it is raining you can borrow an umbrella from the reception for free Also you can use the computers and printers in the Lounge Perfect and strong wi fi all the time free of charge The food in the restaurant is excellent My husband was really touched from the attention of the management our room was decorated for his birthday The Westbridge hotel is a perfect 10 and we will definitely go back there on our next visit to London ,0,203,1
 The location was fine only 10 minutes by bus The hotel is on a main road but was so soundproof The room was so spacious and attractive we stayed in a junior suite and it was lovely The hotel was kind enough to provide us with a bottle of wine and water on arrival our room had every amenity which was replenished daily Wifi was strong and the tv had a few uk channels The bath was HUGE It was definately one of the best highlights The only gripe we really have was over breakfast The price is far too high Admittedly we didn t pre book but even the discounted price is steep for the quality quantity Also the breakfast dining experience seemed somewhat cold and rushed The dinner service on the other hand was faultless and worth every penny One other point was the bed we did ask for a large double and i noticed we had two single matresses sandwhiched together with a double matress topper however this was not noticable when sleeping You get free coffee capsules for the machine every day but if these are dented which a few of ours were they wouldn t work ,0,203,1
 The staff were super friendly on check in and thier helpfulness really endless They found out ot was my brithday and they literally went outof thier way to make sure that I had the most awesome stay ever I really felt like a VIP and they were so patient with my endless barrage of questions and the requests If I really had to say a bad thing it was that I had to wake up the next morning to check out The staff though as they knew I was having an event the night before really pushed the limits for me to let me stay as long as possible to gather my things and the young gentleman who had to trolly up and down with out 1000 bags and boxes thank you so much The reception made me laugh the whole way through and I even got special treatment from thier front of house management Kavita who made sure I understood that her team was the best they are they truely are I m ex hotmel management by the way so trust me I was super duper impressed Keep up the good work I m sending everyone to you ,0,201,1
 This hotel is amazing The location is so perfect Right next to a fantastic shopping street Loads of good fashion houses Walking distance from the Louvre The hotel has a lovely lounge that was stocked with cookies and sweeties all the time Midnight snacks The room s entertainment system is very up to date and you have access to a variety of English films without having to pay a dime The staff were friendly and we were welcomed with hot chocolate which we were allowed to enjoy in the beautiful foyer On our last day which was a Sunday the receptionist sent us the Marais Quarter where we had what I regard as one of the best Sundays days of my life The little streets were filled with people shopping eating falafels etc It was wonderful Great to have hotel staff that bother to give you great tips on were to go Even helped us to order our Uber The hotel is clean and the bathroom was amazing Slipper bath in front of a window over looking Parisian rooftops What more could you ask for I am definitely staying there every time I go to Paris from now on ,0,201,1
 Wow what a beautiful stay I had at this hotel Recently I ve been traveling so much and stayed in different 4 5 star hotels And I can easily say that this hotel deserves more than 4 Starting from check in to the check out Very nice and clean room very comfortable bed Room service and breakfast good selection tasty food yummy breakfast great coffee Haven t tried the restaurant as its a lot of choice out of the hotel but I m sure it s good too In my opinion the gym could be slightly bigger but still better than nothing Shame I haven t had time to try their spa hopefully next time if I m staying with them I will definitely try it out I also liked the little decor on the door little birds it s really cool Makes the hotel design look special Nice and well trained staff Especially the management very friendly and professional Big thank you to Sabir Tahir he made my stay even better as he was able to sort out a little issue I had with room service delivery Great job guys keep doing what you doing the best ,0,200,1
 Cannot recommend this hotel more Booked it as part of a surprise trip for my father s 70th birthday and the staff were fantastic great communication prior to our stay and they happily accommodated a couple of small requests I had They also provided a welcome basket and a bottle of wine I m not sure if this is standard practise or due to the special occasion but it was a nice touch all the same Room was lovely large clean and nicely decorated Location is excellent for getting around London Bank station is a 5 min walk and has great connections to the rest of the city Walking distance to London Bridge St Paul s Cathedral and a number of other attractions The immediate area is very quiet over the weekend not many restaurants bars open so you will have to venture a little further afield As it s the business district Friday night was very lively with local workers but the area seems to shut down Saturday Sunday There is a Wetherspoons right next door to the hotel which does reasonable food and is open every day Overall a fantastic stay I will definitely be back ,0,200,1
 IAt the end of a Danube River cruise my husband and I stayed in Vienna for two extra days I wanted a hotel with local vintage charm and modern comfort On Trip Advisor I found a hotel review with the words My husband loved the smoked salmon at breakfast included Well MY husband loves smoked salmon too I booked it What a lovely hotel We had room 406 Gracious elegant spotlessly clean fantastic bed lavish breakfast in a lovely setting COLD air conditioning opening casement windows behind thick velvet drapes view of the Vienna Theatre with its plaques honoring Beethoven and many others Elevator but also beautiful marble stairs leading down to the beautiful lounge and breakfast rooms 24 hour coffee and tea with some pastries and fruit if you wished The location was also perfect 3 blocks from The Ring and right beside the Naschmarkt where we browsed the food stands and ate two excellent open air dinners Sadly we left on Saturday and missed the weekly Sunday house concert played by an ensemble in the lovely lounge Turned out to be economical also as we could walk to everything My husband said I love this place ,0,200,1
 The Hotel is situated close to the Ledru Rollin metro station and not too far away from Bastille metro station It is very easy to be reached The staff offered us the best service we received during our trip in Paris They are kind friendly courteous and ready to help with a warm smile We were offered an early check in to our surprise we went to the hotel just to leave our luggage until the official check in time but the room had been just released and coffee while we waited the room to get ready for us It was a wonderful surprise for two really tired travellers The room was large enough larger than we expected based on what we read when we made the booking and impeccable The room was also quiet despite a noisy gathering of sports watchers nearby We passed by them on our way back to the hotel The bed was large and comfortable We had a restful sleep The WiFi worked very well and it was fast I would definitely recommend this hotel A big THANK YOU for everyone at the hotel who made our staying really pleasant and comfortable ,0,199,1

 Hotel Cavour is an excellent hotel The staff are very friendly helpful and professional They make you feel welcome and treat you as a welcome quest The hotel is very central and close to the city centre and the Breda district The room was very clean well serviced and having a chocolate put on your bed before bed time is a very nice and personal touch My room had a bath which was good for a nice soaking after a long day of walking I used the excellent spa facility and particularly enjoyed the steam room The spa was also very clean and the spa amenities bag includes a robe and jandals The buffet breakfast was very good too with a wide range of food The cappuccino was tasty and the range croissant very tempting I tried the chocolate and whole wheat ones There were even vegan ones The only suggestion I have is to provide more coffee and tea in the rooms and also some milk There is however a well stocked small supermarket very close to the hotel in the Breda neighbourhood I can recommend this hotel WiFi is free and the signal is strong ,0,199,1
 I arranged a weekend stay for my girlfriend and I for what she thought was for her birthday however I was planning to propose to her over the weekend I contacted the Customer Relations Manager Joe Cunningham who could not have been more helpful in making the weekend as fantastic as it was Firstly we were given a free upgrade to the executive room with a view and what a view it was Including Big Ben Westminster the Thames and the London Eye The room can only be described as extremely well looked after clean and modern with all of the required amenities a young couple should need for a weekend break On our second night after I became engaged to be wed as a way of celebration Joe arranged for a large bottle of prosecco strawberries and a strawberry cheesecake gluten free to be left in our room and beautifully arranged with rose petals by his assistant Yann I can not thank Joe Yann and all of the staff at the Park Plaza Riverbank enough for making our weekend so perfect and we will be returning on our next trip to the capital Absolutely fantastic ,0,198,1
 What a find and what a gem of a modern boutique hotel A peaceful retreat in a lovely situation yet only 5 minutes away from a tube station and excellent transport links A long established hotel but refurbished during the last few years our double room was so well appointed modern light and airy with excellent facilities such as the ultra modern bathroom and easy to adjust heating system The beds were extremely comfortable two marvellous nights sleep Breakfast was included in the excellent room rate making this exceptional value for money The continental breakfast was plentiful with extremely helpful efficient staff seated in the conservatory which was light bright and inviting Everywhere was spotlessly clean throughout the hotel The reception area was welcoming and secure being able to leave luggage for collection was a real plus Once again all the reception staff were so very helpful We liked the idea of the loyalty scheme since it suggests a genuine interest in retaining your custom This was our first time at the Henley House Hotel but it definitely won t be our last already signed up to the loyalty scheme Many thanks for a superb stay ,0,198,1

 I stayed in The Enterprise Hotel with my sister we were in Milan to attend the opera at La Scala The hotel is in an excellent location a residential area 20 minutes on the tram from the city centre The trams are a very iconic part of the transport system in Milan and the journeys are so enjoyable The Hotel has every facility and the reception staff are quite outstanding in their level of attention and they also provide informative and accurate information An added bonus is being able to buy your tram ticket at the hotel The hotel also has a very efficient taxi booking service The room was very comfortable bathroom an ample size and tea coffee making facilities are in the room I requested an iron and it was brought to the room complete with ironing board in less than 5 minutes very impressive It was wonderful to be able to stay in a hotel in Milan that was in a very quiet area but also within such easy reach of the city centre I can recommend the Enterprise Hotel to all travellers and I would stay there if I visit Milan again ,0,198,1

 This hotel is just across the Wien Mitte station From this station the airport express train departs You can also check in your bags here before you go to the airport A shoppingcenter with a lot of great places to eat at Have in mind most of the shops are closed on Sundays It is a big hotel You can sit in the reception area to really realx or just access to the Wi Fi There is also computers you can use for check in or just search interesting things Breakfast is in the restaurant area there is a lot to choose from You can also bring a small bag with you when you leave they have fruits and water if you want We didn t hear any noise from the street below we had a view to that street Very nice beds and pillows You can make yourself coffee or tea and a small refrigerator A safety box is in the closet You can easily take the subway from this location to any interesting building park It is clean and fresh so I would stay here again if I go back to Vienna ,0,196,1
 2nd May 2017 The reception staff were so friendly and helpful nothing seemed too much trouble I love the cookies My daughter and i had a twin room beds were very comfortable 248 room was very spacious and clean view was of the car park but i wasn t there for the view Breakfast around 15 00 was all good sausages bacon eggs hash browns beans toast as well as all the other healthy options I think my son 20 went up 3 times Hotel was a 5 minute walk across a carpark to Prince Regent DLR station near Excel and a short underground ride with 1 change at canning town to the 02 taxi home from the 02 at 10 30 was 32 00 traffic was very slow due to Ed Sheeran concert o We also walked to the Emirates Air line from the hotel which took around 20 minutes the trip over the Thames was brilliant used my Oyster card and I think it was 3 70 What with all the shopping we did and the concert it was a shame we didn t get to spend more time in the hotel ,0,196,1
 A rarity amongst hotels it looked as good in real life as it does in its pictures Very comfortable and full of thoughtful touches For example instead of the usual mini bottle of shampoo in the shower there was a large shampoo a large conditioner and a large hair repairer There were free tea and coffee with mini cakes and biscuits 24 hours a day There was even a large glass container of iced mint leaves for those who like mint tea Oh and jars of sweets too The bedrooms are all individually designed and lack nothing The staff were constantly attentive and cheerful and nothing was too much trouble The breakfast choice was very extensive the best we have come across in our four years of travelling Europe and the scrambled eggs were constantly replenished so that they were always fresh and never past their best as so often happens if you get to breakfast late Breakfast was available until 11am another plus point Downsides 55 per 24 hour for parking but still cheaper than street parking The only thing that could improve the hotel would be a large open fire blazing away ,0,196,1
 Mon Hotel is a charming boutique hotel located near Champs Elysees in a little street coming from l Avenue des Grand Armees near the Bus Direct stop airport shuttle The metro station Argentine line 1 is just 2 min away and it can lead you everywhere in town Very nice caf s and restaurants near by though not the most glamourous neighborhood you can find in Paris The mini market Le Marche d Etoile offers fresh fruits and all the basic things one might need The street is very quiet and the hotel is located in a very nice classical building The service at the reception is great loved it the staff is really helpful The room is so confy specially the bed Air conditioning works great as well as the wifi To end up the best features every room has a smartphone where you can navigate freely in and out of the hotel amazing right and before your stay the hotel sends you an email asking for your guest needs explaining how to get there nearby restaurants and attractions never experienced this kind of service before I was really WOWed Highly recommended ,0,195,1
 Perfect quiet spot close to Champs Elysees We visited during the Easter break a family of four and got two deluxe rooms on the 5th floor Charming old style lift that was very efficient The staff were very helpful accommodating and attentive especially Mehdhat who helped us from our first step into the hotel to getting us into the taxi as we left The hotel was classic and very comfortable the rooms were huge by European standards and both had small balconies as well At the lobby there was all day bread snacks drinks available which was perfect for a quick bite before or after a day of shopping sightseeing The lounge bar area was a beautiful place with a terrific skylight perfect to chill out with a beer and some conversation The minibar in the room is consumable water soft drinks juice a rarity these days which they kept it stocked on daily basis If you need other items there was a small convenience store just a couple minutes away It was a great place away from the bustle and noise of Champs Elysees and just 10 minute walk away from shopping ,0,195,1
 I loved my stay at The Little Palace Hotel I was staying an extra night after my travelling companions headed in different directions It was easy to find the staff were super courteous and the decor was a little edgy up to date and very clean My room as I suspect they all are was small but completely adequate internally The designers have done a great job prioritising what matters comfy bed good quality shower just enough bench space for toiletries a small amount of storage plenty enough for a few nights worth of clothes and not including what doesn t little toiletries of low quality that I never use anyway I also had a balcony room that had an AMAZING view over the roof tops of Paris including being able to see the top of the Eiffel Tower I have been to Paris quite a number of times before and this experience still blew me away I loved it The location was great for exploring Le Marais and around too Very central really I wish I had been staying for more than a night and would definitely stay here again Thanks ,0,194,1
 This hotel was one of only a few we could find to accommodate our family of 6 We really enjoyed the pedestrian street on which it was located It was very close to a metro stop We loved the outdoor patio courtyard where we could rest after site seeing or have food drink Our large family room on the 1st floor one floor up from the lobby was spacious The kids loved the bunk beds and we appreciated the two large bathrooms Our windows opened up to the courtyard mentioned above We were always greeted by friendly staff members Before we arrived we weren t sure we were going to pay for the breakfast which cost extra However we decided that morning to get it The buffet was AMAZING So many things to choose from and a wonderful espresso cappuccino machine The food kept us satisfied until we boarded our ship around 2 pm Our server was helpful and kind They stored our luggage after we checked out until they called us a cab when we left Thank you Petit Palace Opera Boqueria Garden We definitely would stay with you again ,0,193,1
 Luxury Suites is an amazing place I am very familiar with Amsterdam and visit a lot So I have stayed in many hotels and AirBnB s The rooms are huge the views sweeping and grand The facilities are modern and sleek but extravagant at the same time The Staff was unreal in terms of outreach responding to issues there was only one and attention to detail I hosted friends in my room for pre dinner cocktails and the Royal Suite was perfect The breakfast which I only ate on my last day was amazing I cheated myself not eating there every morning What a variety The location is ideal It is a little east of center so you have quick access to all the joys of Amsterdam but a bit more peace and quiet at night Lots of precious spots nearby to enjoy and so may spots to snap a great trip recording picture I must single out Wladimir who was amazing my whole stay and even before In fact all the staff were great but he deserves a special acknowledgement I will return here again and again for my trips ,0,193,1
 We stayed at the Ampersand Hotel Kensington on the eve of our wedding and our wedding night The staff were so friendly and helpful especially Miguel who showed us to our room and helped with our bags The hotel itself was clean and as described on their website We were not disappointed with our room which was a compact but functional suite on the 5th floor the room had a well stocked complimentary mini bar robe slippers tv s etc and even our own secure wifi bubble it also had a balcony over looking Harrington Road which was nice The little extras that the hotel staff arranged were so thoughtful I received a little postcard an hour after we arrived wishing me a happy stay and wonderful day accompanied by a small box of tasty sweet treats On our arrival back at the hotel after our wedding celebrations there was a plate in our room with happy wedding written on it in chocolate and more sweet treats it was such a lovely touch We would not hesitate to recommend the Ampersand Hotel and will definitely be back for our anniversary ,0,192,1
 Incredibly comfortable beds Very large rooms my husband and I were on the top floor with our own bathroom and large walk in closet and the boys had their own downstairs Kids were 8 and 9 and had a blast they were super impressed with the room On the write up air conditioning was not mentioned and therefore I just figured the hotel was not equipped with it an incredibly nice surprise when she walked into the room and a big waft of cold air hit us the air conditioning was perfect The accommodations couldn t have been better We are at the restaurant for one dinner and we re quite disappointed with the quality for the cost poor value The pool is dark and tranquil heavy chlorine Seems only kids use it but because it is within the spa section the employees kept asking for everyone to be quite veryhallenging with 10 kids under 10 in an echoing environment We all had fun The location was super 5 min walk to the Louvre and right across the street from the park Definitely great with kids Subway across the street ,0,192,1
 I loved the fresh industrial chic Exactly my type of decor I built my own bed from scaffolding so its safe to say that we share the same artistic taste The food was lovely and fresh staff approachable and upbeat The environment was simply joyous The music for breakfast was upbeat dance music but not too energetic Every detail was on point and i loved the light humour dotted everywhere that signified that the hotel doesn t take life too seriously Located only two stops from the airport to the east about 10 mins on the train and 20 25 mins on the tram to the city centre It s right by Amsterdam ArenA so would be ideal if staying for a sporting event I promise that i don t work for the hotel either feel free to run a background check In 10 years of working in the airline industry i ve stayed in my fair share of hotels and can easily say that this stands head shoulders feet and stilts above any of my other stays others feel so too it scored highest on other comparison sites too ,0,192,1
 I loved the hotel staff all in general are super professional and they really care about clients Normally i always stay in 5 hotels and this one being a 4 is far better than many superior hotels Trust in what i have to say this hotel is really great the staff the rooms great breakfast sky lounge on the rooftop is fun I have to say as well thank you to Am lcar from far the best professional i ve met made me feel at home and was always concerned with clients being happy I really felt at home with him what a wonderfull person and professional for a 7 hotel I normally travel to Amsterdam a couple of times a year and from now this hotel will be the home i choose yes the home i really felt it For ending thank you for everything and continue the great work i see that if people that are working are happy with the job and are treated well by the bosses from the top it will reflect in the experience for the clients This is a happy hotel Best Regards Nuno,0,192,1
 It was my 3rd stay in Amsterdam and this is by far the best The King executive room was exactly as expected very spacious clean and bright The bed and pillows were the comfiest of them all Also the view was very pleasant to wake up to as I was on the 9th floor I had a clear view of the city The 17th floor roof top area is such a beautiful relaxing open space with an incredible view equipped with a bar a comfy chill out area sunbeds and also lovely chairs sofas and tables to eat Staff were so welcoming and polite that I questioned whether anyone ever had a bad day They were very helpful and informative on what to do in Amsterdam and where the best spots were and even gave us a toothbrush and 2 adaptors to borrow when asked for no extra cost It s about 15 20 mins from Amsterdam central on tram and the tram stop is about a 3 minute walk so overall I would recommend this hotel for all types of stay because I will be returning with no doubt ,0,192,1
 I liked the everything comfortable room bathroom was large enough and had a bath separately with ocean salt The hotel offers 4 types of pillow which is really make comfortable your sleep The room is very clean and nice We had a room with balcony to Duomo Piazza The only problem is that the hotel does not have a restaurant and in order to have your breakfast you have to make order till 2 am They bring it to the room This creates a problem because you do not know what time you wake up next day in this case you have to plan your wake up You may also order in the morning but it takes 30 min to prepare and bring to your room Also the small table in the room is not comfortable to have a breakfast on it Therefore the next day I preferred to have a good coffee and some wonderful cakes and croissants at Crunchy Pastry near the hotel Bear in mind that hotel mostly has king size bedrooms and with only duvet cover it is not really comfortable if you sleep with child ,0,192,1
 I stayed here one night while in Amsterdam for buisness I needed a hotel room in the area and picked this hotel based on ratings on trip advisor It fitted my needs perfectly I stayed in a standard room and was very happily surpriced to see I had been given a corner room with lots of light see pics Am guessing there are only three or four of these rooms so it was a great luck However if you are a light sleeper the noice from the street and nearby railroad might disturb ypu a bit The room was clean and seemed newly renovated It had everything I needed including an easy to use alarm clock and several sockers for charging my electronic devices The bed was super comfy that I decided to stay in bed a bit longer in the morning and skip breakfast When checking out the nice receptionist offered me to have a coffe and something to go as I did not have time to sit down for breakfast I will make sure to return to this hotel when in this area of Amsterdam next time ,0,191,1
 My husband and I stayed there for one night as a wedding anniversary getaway and it was just perfect It s a classic hotel with modern touches and a feeling of understated luxury We booked a deluxe double room online but then were given an option to upgrade to a larger newer room by paying around 80 more on check in As with many classic hotels in Paris some rooms haven t been renovated yet I suppose The beds are ultra comfortable the room was spacious with a small kitchenette and table and the service was great But the big plus of the hotel is its excellent location It s just steps away from the Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe yet it is discreetly located on a surprisingly tranquil street We ve stayed there before in a suite with our two kids and were able to use the swimming pool and gym Compared to other larger hotels in the area with similar facilities it s actually a good value You can easily pay double or triple the price for the larger flashier hotels in the neighborhood ,0,190,1
 Clean hotel spotless rooms friendly staff secure location Reasonable rates Directly across the street from Gare d lest with easy access to both regional trains and the Metro I have stayed in this hotel twice in the past 3 months and have been pleased both times Breakfast is very nice as well Check in and out are very quick and efficient I spend very little time in my room when I travel on leisure this one perfectly does the job as a very very clean and quiet place to sleep and refresh and then get right on the move again Rooms are on the smaller side but plenty big for my purposes I had all the room I required Staff speaks multiple languages Luggage may be left at the hotel upon checkout on the day of your final stay to be picked up later so that you don t have to tour with your bags Keep in mind when booking this is a simple hotel not a resort I rated it on meeting my needs of all the things listed above It does the job perfectly Very satisfied ,0,190,1
 From the moment I called to confirm reservation and spoke with Kenya front desk I knew our stay here would be wonderful She was friendly and a true professional Questions never bothered anyone at the hotel as we learned how to make our way around Barcelona We arrived after 9 pm from the airport and were greeted by Joan a vibrant young man We were helped to our room by Alex and Xavier bell hops who were friendly and took the time to show us around the hotel and explained their wonderful 11 am 11 pm snack area where we assisted by Fabian waiter On subsequent days we were assisted with where to go for great restaurants how to get there using the train or subway by Raul Juan Carlos and Alejo Everyone at Catalonia Square went above and beyond to assure we had the most memorable vacation in Barcelona I would strongly recommend this hotel again if for no other reason than to get to know and enjoy the amenities location and the STAFF I cannot say enough kind complimentary words to describe everyone at the hotel ,0,190,1

 The bed was amazing room was a very good size could not fault the staff at all They gave me a complimentary breakfast because I was having a bad day Which was a lovely little perk room service room was erm well the Menu left a lot to be desired I understand certain staple items on menus so that all the guest have something to choose from but the menu was just so boring nothing on the menu that was beyond the norm or sparked up a appetite in any shape or form and as a lone guest I wasn t keen on dining in the restaurant by myself and I like to dine in the room but the room service menu could do with a fresher take But the gentleman that served me was lovely most of the tv channels didn t work in the room and I couldn t get a phone signal but the hotel provides a mobile you can use during the stay Which is a very unique touch from the montcalm hotel chain and amazing value for money all in all ,0,188,1

 Everything is great When I arrived I received a free upgrade from a room on the ground floor boring to a room on the third floor with a peaceful view of some buildings The bed was enormous king size and the room was very modern clean and stylish I loved the massive shower and personalised A X E L soap shampoo conditioner containers The staff from reception to the people who work in the restaurant to the ladies who clean the rooms were friendly and accommodating It s not super super budget but not extremely expensive either Worth the money in all respects I love the rooftop bar it s a lovely place to relax after a long day particularly if you re visiting Barcelona for a certain festival held in August The breakfast is quite simple but pretty tasty I only ate it once There is a sushi bar and various other restaurants almost right next door to the hotel which I preferred The gay theme is great but saw lots of straight people too Overall so welcoming and wonderful would definitely stay here again ,0,188,1

 Our daughter has lived in Amsterdam for nine months and when she gave us the opportunity to join her she made a reservation for us to stay at the Park Hotel As we entered the hotel we were immediately greeted with a glass of cucumber water from a staff member situated separately from the registration desk This was a very welcoming gesture Every staff member no matter what their role provided us with the same care The entrance and reception areas are modern and light pours in through the large glass exterior We landed early stored our luggage and left for our daughter s home Hotel personnel texted that our room was ready before the checkin time From our room we could see a bit of the main canal which was fun and we discovered the hotel is located in a central location Our experience at the hotel was short but we very much enjoyed Amsterdam seeing the city through our daughter s eyes Her choice of the Park Hotel played a part in our enjoyment We highly recommend a stay in the Park Hotel ,0,187,1
 Pol and Grace is an adorable hotel In reality it looks even better than what it is shown in the photos All the people that work there are caring calm and helpful I loved the aroma the place had it made me feel very peaceful and relaxed The room was very comfortable clean and decorated with taste As the other guests have mentioned there is delicious coffee tea and water in the lobby available all the time for free As coffee lovers this detail made us very happy The food that was offered for breakfast was fresh and tasty The only thing that I would suggest to the staff is to try and keep the scrambled eggs and sausages warm during the whole breakfast period The area is very quiet and beautiful There are metro and bus stations near by We preferred walking and it was very easy to get around Getting from the hotel to the famous Park Guell took us 25 minutes by foot If we ever have the chance to be in Barcelona again we would look for no other place ,0,186,1
 We stayed here for our honeymoon for 3 nights The location was incredible in the Gothic Quarter and yet only a 10 minute walk to the beach We were greeted with glasses of cava which were refilled often and an introduction to the hotel and the nearby area attractions The manager as well as the front desk staff we waited too long to do this review and have forgotten the names were so friendly and helped us to find great places to eat and explore as well as making reservations for us The room was beautiful spacious and very modern when we arrived in the room there was an arrangement of chocolate chorizo and cava as well as some beautiful flowers There is a wonderful rooftop terrace with a bar and a small pool with views overlooking the marina and the Gothic Quarter really nice to spend some time up here They also have a really cool bar and library on the first floor as well as a Michelin star restaurant When we come back to Barcelona we look forward to staying here again ,0,186,1
 What a wonderful time we had at the Catalonia Born All of the staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful Deborah was especially nice When we arrived I leaned on a counter that had just been painted Deborah had my shirt cleaned and back to me the same day with a bottle of Cava The room was comfortable and had lots of space to put things very good wifi lots of electrical outlets and the best bed we ve ever slept in Breakfast had everything you can imagine hot and cold food juices good coffee Also every day from 14 00 to 23 00 in the lobby there was a complementary buffet with sandwiches cakes salads soups drinks it was greatly appreciated after long hours of walking There s also an excellent tapas restaurant right across the street Elsa y Fred And one more very nice memory the hotel noticed from my passport that I was having a birthday and sent up another bottle of Cava with a birthday greeting We will definitely be back in Barcelona and stay at the Catalonia Born ,0,186,1
 The staff were very friendly and helpful Others who have stayed here noted their dismay at it not being located near an U Bahn station however the hotel is about one city block distance from the Unteres Belvedere tram line stop on the 71 line that goes to the Opera Ring area and Karlsplatz U Bahn station U1 U2 and U4 lines Also the staff can arrange a taxi to the airport when you leave so all in all this hotel affords you a little peace quiet from the humming tourist center part of Vienna while allowing easy access to the main shopping tourist spots Other reviewers noted problems with the WiFi but signal strength was more than adequate even allowing for good connection for using FaceTime stayed on the 2nd floor The breakfast was an impressive spread of hot and cold items with plenty of seating in the breakfast room Room itself was clean and on par if a little more spacious than rooms in B B s that I ve previously stayed at just off Karntner Strasse Would definitely stay here again ,0,186,1
 The staff were exceptionally helpful and very friendly and cheerful all the time Nothing was too much trouble We particularly enjoyed the well presented little touches in our very comfortable Superior room from coffee and tea making facilities unusual in Spain lovely range of toiletries and useful information about Barcelona to chocolates on the pillows at night There was even a small savoury snack of local delicacies waiting in our room when we arrived We were also loaned a 4G dongle by the hotel so we had secure roaming data for the duration of our stay which was very handy indeed Location is excellent Its a lovely area and within walking distance to most attractions but the metro station is only about 50m away if that and easy to navigate so it is easy to get around the city Lots of places to eat and drink close by as well We did not eat in the hotel at all as we don t do breakfast and were out and about in the evenings We loved the hotel and Barcelona and will definitely be back ,0,186,1
 This was an excellent option for us as a family of four We have stayed in many four person rooms in city breaks across Europe and this was one of the best Plenty of space and very comfortable great shower lots of storage Our boys are 9 and 6 and they enjoy playing this hotel has a courtyard in the middle which they could use for games and running around In general the hotel was modern and didn t have any tired looking furniture which you tend to find elsewhere The location of the hotel was good as well for us although a little away from the centre the centre was only a short metro ride away Also next to the hotel you have a supermarket a bank and also one block away a pedestrianized zone with shops cafes etc The main train station is also only 5 minutes walk away for trips out of Vienna Overall for a city break in Europe for a family of four who don t want to spend five star prices on accommodation Hotel Zeitgeist cannot be faulted ,0,186,1
 Enjoyed our stay at this hotel arrived early and were able to check in this being 11am which was great staff at reception were very helpful and welcoming Room was nice and clean and bed was really comfortable only thing I would say about the room the carpet was a little dated Couldn t of asked for a better location bang in the middle of Mayfair itself local to trains and bus services lots of lovely shops in the surrounding area and only 10 mins walk to regent street and oxford street Only thing i was disappointed with in the hotel was that the breakfast was too expensive 35 literally 2 mins walk away there was a fab place fo eat called Henrys cafe bar which cooked the best breakfast full English for 10 including tea or coffee so definitely worth eating of a morning in there There is lots of lovely restaurants in the surrounding area we ate at Hakasan Mayfair also Mr fogs residence for afternoon tea Back to the Mayfair Hotel I would most certainly stay there again in the future ,0,186,1
 The hotel is in a side alley off of the canal easy to reach from the Metro Porta Genova It doesn t look up to much from the outside but much better inside The staff were very friendly and helpful Beds very comfortable we had a room with a sofa too plus a small balcony which overlooked a quiet square filled with trees and singing birds in the evenings The free drink voucher was great as was the aperitivo buffet free too although the lobby area where it is served lacks ambience Disappointed with the roof terrace not shown in photos and not worth a visit What appears to be the roof terrace in the photos with parasols etc is out the back of the hotel lobby Very clean bathroom very good with some nice toiletries Robe and slippers provided Lively area with lots of bars and restaurants very busy on a Saturday night Recommend the Mag Caf for cocktails and El Brellin for dinner and any other bar to sit with a glass of Aperol Would recommend this hotel and the whole area ,0,186,1
 Megan at the front desk was amazing swift check in and she was nice enough to bring me and my partner glasses of champagne and a small box of chocolates I went for a bigger sized room as I was skeptical about space But for the two of us the room was humongous and my partner was pleased earnt myself brownie points we didn t stay at the hotel for long as we are a young couple we was out in town and at restaurants but when we did spend time we didn t want to leave very clean rooms irons kettles iron board robes clean sheets everyday and complimentary hot drinks in your room was surprised that the staff are friendly enough even at 1am in the morning to grab me a glass of coke Luxury hotel and affordable prices I cannot stress how much Megan made our stay as pleasant as possible Great ambassador for the brand Was even able to push my check out time by an hour for free Amazing experience hope it s same again when we return ,0,185,1
 Everything was great on my recent stay in that hotel and all was up to perfect in terms of the staff and the exotic services and facility provided by the hotel also location is fabulous One thing I would like to mention about my experience with that hotel i made my booking through hotel booking web site and it was non refundable one month and a half before my Arrival so when I have checked the price of the room I have booked later in the site I found cheaper than the price I booked my room for so I made I contact the hotel booking customer service and explain the matter and they have respond immediately to my request and sent a notification to the reservation department in intercontinental park lane hotel and thay agreed right away to modify it and they sent me a new booking confirmation with the new price offered in the website I appreciate that so much and proof to me that is hotel booking is the best choise to book my hotel in my future trip ,0,184,1
 We arrived here on a Saturday afternoon around 1 Unfortunately our room wasn t ready as check in was at 2 but we were able to leave our baggage there which was a God send considering how heavy mine was We arrived back late afternoon early evening and our room was ready it didn t take long to check in as all the staff were courteous n helpful I was impressed with the decor of the hotel as it s very smart with tasteful Xmas decorations all around We booked the standard room for a 2 night stay in London it was comfortable and clean The only thing I have to point out is there was only 1 robe in the room I booked a twin room My companion was unconcerned by this as she had alternatives to wear I m sure if I raised it at reception they would have resolved the matter at hand Check out was brief n swift with no issues Overall a very nice hotel and I would definitely be visiting again on my next trip to london,0,184,1
 My Husband and I visited Club Quarters Lincolns Inn Field to celebrate Valentine s weekend and we were very impressed Having been fortunate enough to stay in several 4 and 5 star hotels in our amazing Capital City its great to find another hotel tucked away in a quiet spot which I would recommend We visited London to see Motown the musical another must see if you are lucky enough to be in town which transports you to an era of great music stopping at one feel good song after another Shaftesbury Theatre is a 10 minute walk from the hotel The hotel has a brilliant location away from the hustle and bustle but within walking distance of Covent Garden Oxford Street and Bond Street so fab for shopping All of the staff were very helpful and friendly and free tea coffee fruit and sweets in the lounge a nice little extra We had a queen room which over looked the pretty Lincolns Inn Field Green I am looking forward to returning to have a cocktail on the terrace in the summer ,0,184,1
 I ve been staying at the hotel since the mid 1960 s when it was a family enterprise It is now commercial but so are a lot of hotels worldwide and new construction in Vienna This review is colored by memories 50 years ago when I first stayed at the Mailberger Hof it was a scrumptious little place in the Inner City hidden a bit from the mainstream foot traffic or in the old days auto traffic as well We also remember staying there in the early 1980s when we were making one of our personal pilgrimages to one of the most classically beautiful cities in the world At that time there was one apartment at the top level of the hotel now more gracious and large and we and our children now early 40s stayed there for a month Based on currency the hotel has aged a lot along with its furnishings and fun has transformed into functional It is definitely that and easy to recommend as price worthy and location terrific if you want to be in the First District ,0,184,1
 Beautiful comfortable and spacious bedroom and bathroom The bedroom had an excellent view of the city The staff were friendly and very helpful especially Elena who was fabulous in giving us directions and suggesting places to go The restaurant bar on the 23rd floor has a stunning view of the city and it s really worth going up for a drink at night we re only sorry we didn t go a second time The member of staff on duty when we went I don t know his name unfortunately went to extra effort to make a delicious white sangria for my friend even though this wasn t something on the menu We spent a couple of hours in the spa which was a lovely and relaxing experience too In terms of location this hotel is also very convenient it s directly across from a train station with regular trains to from the airport It s also near the metro and within walking distance from the centre for example we walked to the Sagrada Familia in about 30 min Highly recommended hotel ,0,184,1
 The breakfast although expensive 18 5 euros each was lovely Lots to choose from and eggs bacon etc cooked to order Staff were friendly Rooms were spacious cleaned daily sheets and towels changed too Bathroom was huge and shower gel shampoo conditioner replenished daily There s also a hairdryer in the bathroom The hotel is in a central position just around the corner from the cathedral We were able to walk to the port placa catalyna la ramblas etc in about 10 minutes There were loads of police everywhere we walked which made us feel safer but we made sure our belongings etc were kept nearby in case of pickpockets etc We went on the Wednesday evening walking tour and the guide was amusing and knowledgable We found lots of authentic tapas bars and lots of squares to sit and have a glass of cava The best part of the trip was a Segway tour which we arranged ourselves and the instructor David was superb We had such a laugh Would definitely come back to Barcelona and stay in this hotel again ,0,184,1
 From the moment I arrived at the hotel everyone to include the hotel manager front desk representative and another employee was helpful and professional The parking was free and convenient During my check in I was offered a refreshment drink and my daughter was provided a coloring book and crayons they clearly love kids I asked for a dinner recommendation which was above my expectations and very close to the hotel The hotel is in a great location in the city near several restaurants and shops you can easily walk to The small gym was located on the top floor but was just what I needed to get a morning run in Afterwards I stood outside on the top floor taking in the fresh air while looking out at the city Lastly the room was located on the 5th floor with a balcony everything was clean organized and comfortable I frequently travel and I have seen many hotels rated 5 stars that are clearly not this 4 star hotel gets 5 stars from me I WILL be back Thank you March 2016 ,0,184,1
 What is special about Casa Bonay it is the special feeling you get from the first step you put in You feel like in an other epoch It is more than a great 4 hotel because it allows you to feel home at the same time The building itself is beautiful and recently renewed Rooms are clean comfortable with a minimal design decor and beautiful tiles floor I loved the bath necessaries with a very special graphic image If I have to find something to say it is about the roll curtains not always easy to manage and a missing chair especially if you spend more days in the room All the related place to eat drinks are great for the design colors atmosphere music Totally in love with the lobby where you can have a good drinks or glass of wine enjoying evening or afternoon Love the printed shirts corner near the reception The whole concept of Casa Bonay it is simply great Not last all the staff is young efficient always ready to help I would definitely recommend this place ,0,184,1
 I researched numerous Paris hotels and chose Hotel Westminster because it looked traditional and lovely and was in a good location for us What we received was all that and much more Unexpectedly I needed something translated from German to English and the Concierge found someone in the hotel who helped me immediately and I got help I needed at the small business center off the lobby Also I left some possessions in the room after checking out and I received an email from the hotel before I realized that I had left them The price for on on line offering was at a deep discount so I did not expect to have one of the larger rooms pictured on their website but the bathroom was large which was helpful to us Our room was quiet although near the Place de L Opera I was amazed how many Paris hotels are advertised with photos of stark furnishings bathed in neon colored light If you share my aversion to that version of sleek you might appreciate Westminster as much as we did ,0,183,1
 I booked this last minute due to commuters chaos and train failure at Paddington I thought what could happen in a luxurious four star hotel I checked in at 22 00 hoping I ll finally get a good nights sleep I had stayed with my parents at Cumberland as a child even before the refurbishment I always felt safe and happy there However I had a sleepless night due to my hectic day and delays Only to doze off shortly after 3 am Then we were woken up by the fire alarm and had to evacuate at 5 45 Half awake dressed on the way down There was not slippers nor a cotton gown in my room The air quality was bad All residents stayed out for no less than 30 minutes I understand accidents happen but no explanation was given I checked out at 7 20 because I couldn t stand staying on the premises I paid 228 for three hours of broken sleep and no breakfast Not even the courtesy of an explanation of what the fire was about ,0,183,1
 My family and I booked one twin room and one double room the twin room was spacious and very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable which were lovely to look forward to after a long day of shopping I especially liked the small extras that made quite the difference to make our stay enjoyable we had extra pillows and extra towels at hand and all the other standard amenities like a hair drier and an iron I enjoyed using the hotel s complementary hi speed WIFI that was available through out the hotel The hotel has a great atmosphere and is located in a prime location in London just a stone s throw away from the major landmarks like Hyde Park and Marble Arch as well as the many other major landmarks of London Breakfast at the Market restaurant was slightly over priced but their excellent options compensate for this There are quite a lot of food options that would suit all tastes The staff and porters are very welcoming and helpful they were prompt Overall a very welcoming hotel ,0,183,1
 The hotel is ideally located in the heart of Amsterdam It provides an easy access to the main attractions in the city The Anne Frank museum is just steps away The city center is a 5 min walk The rooms were appropriate for staying in the heart of Amsterdam While the photos of the hotel on the web did deter us initially from making a booking in reality they do not reflect the warm coziness that we felt once we were there This was due to the truly great service we received at the hotel Upon arrival the staff were very helpful in unloading the bags While our rooms were being prepared they ensured that we could enjoy your bar with the freshly brewed coffee The freshly brewed coffee was incidentally one of the best we have tasted During both days the staff at the hotel were always ready to help they never ever declined any of our requests The breakfast has just perfect Our stay is characterized by superlatives And so our visit to Amsterdam left us with wonderful memories ,0,183,1
 Every member of staff went above and beyond to ensure that our stay at the Marriott County Hall was absolutely fantastic When I mentioned at check in that my husband and I were spending a last night together before he went away for four months work we were asked to wait in the stunning bar for ten minutes and when we went up to our room there were rose petals on the bed and complimentary champagne in an ice bucket plus a box of chocolate truffles Incredible service and such a lovely surprise The room itself was perfect the bed sumptuous and everything had been recently renovated in a luxurious modern style that still managed to echo and complement the history of the building Little touches like being able to easily link our laptop to the TV and watch movies from our own Netflix account was a huge bonus The hotel and amenities were beautiful but it was the wonderful friendly service where nothing was too much trouble that made our stay so memorable I hope we ll be back soon ,0,183,1
 First things first The room was just amazing Not too small not huge but just the right size Well decorated practical and as clean as it gets Also it s been a while since I slept in such comfy bed It was like being hugged I had forgotten what it was like to have a perfect night s sleep The hotel is located in a very quiet albeit central area And we didn t hear any noise coming from other rooms Surprinsingly the internet conexion was great The bathroom was pretty awesome as well Let s just say that there was a tub and the floor was warm which I found was a nice touch like a cherry on the top of a sundae The friendliness of the staff is another point worth mentioning the airline company had lost our luggage and they went above and beyond what was required to try and help us To wrap it up we couldn t have asked for a better hotel at such a good price I d stay there again in a minute ,0,183,1
 Hi I booked one night at the Grosvenor Hotel between April 13 and 14 2017 This stay was a gift for my mum and 8 year old daughter They went to Harry Potter Studios on the 13th and were due to return to London Centre late that evening I cannot tell you how amazing the staff at the Grosvenor were They answered all my questions and ensure that my mum and daughter had a wonderful time They provided them with a beautiful room on the 4th floor and a very delicious breakfast I am grateful to the staff for making an extra effort for my family and making their experience a memorable one My mum does not speak English but someone at the hotel that speaks Spanish was there to help her stay easier Thank you for all the little details that made a difference in their stay and in my peace of mind Whether you will visit the Grosvenor for a special occasion or wish to surprise a love one I can assure you this is an excellent choice ,0,182,1
 It was an excellent stay and I have nothing bad to say about this hotel It has a great location and proximity to Porta Venezia metro station is a huge plus My room was very comfortable bathroom was in a good standard The renovation work hasn t disturbed me much Breakfast is good there is a choice for everyone s taste I believe Wifi is strong and worked perfectly on all of my devices But the best thing about this hotel is the staff Everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming Very nice staff at the reception they were ready to help before I even looked at them They had a great knowledge of the city and its attractions Always greeted me back with a smile and a nice word Also the staff supervising the breakfast was very professional the lady who was there everyday made sure all worked perfectly Every staff member whom I have encountered from the reception to the maids was smiled polite and friendly I think this is how the good places are becoming the great places ,0,182,1
 I have stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my husband and my child 12 years old The room I received was on the 3th floor with a nice view of the city no smoking and far from the elevator perfect Furthermore the room which was a Superior was very big clean and comfortable We had breakfast in the restaurant of the hotel It is expensive 15 euros per person 10 euros for child but the price is absolutely in line with the quality and quantity of food you may eat And fresh juice espresso and cappuccino are included in such price Check in and check out were fast and precise The wi fi is free and even if is a low one and has to be reconnected each hour it is a good one I absolutely recommend this hotel for its price 622 euros for triple room for 3 nights superior room breakfast included its position 12 minutes by tram from the very city centre the kindness and competence of its staff and cleanliness of all the spaces ,0,182,1
 We stayed here the first time and had a great experience great room the room service order got screwed up but we weren t to bothered Awesome location We liked it so much we came back a few days later and it was terrible I think we must have been upgraded to a nicer room the first time without being told so the second time when they offered us an upgraded room we declined thinking it would be the same as before It sure wasn t The room stunk had a bank of about 20 aircon units outside the window the air con in the room didn t work so we had to have the windows open in the middle of winter to keen it cool The bathroom was filthy and the bed extremely uncomfortable and squeaky Would never stay in this rooms again but the upgraded rooms are really good They also screwed up our room service order the second time and the operator didn t know what a hashbrown was even though it was on the menu ,0,181,1
 On arrival I was told that the room wasn t ready OK It had just turned 13 00hrs I was also told that I had booked a double room that only measured 8sqm It might be too small for me I could however if available upgrade into a room that was 12m for an extra 13 per day more I said ok I will do that The person on reception a young Spanish man by the name of Juan was very heplfull and also very polite We left our baggage there walked around for an hour or so and then came back and checked in to the hotel The room we were given was ample clean and fine for the short stay in London 3 days The quiet location of the hotel is great when you use the bus system and an oyster card to get around As said staff very helpful but be aware of the small rooms I heard many complaints whilst in the lobby from guests saying how small their rooms were But we were happy ,0,181,1
 I loved the comfort of my room and the super fast Wi Fi It was great to know that after a full day of tiring sight seeing I had a clean safe and comfy room to look forward to The heating was excellent and the bathroom was clean which is always a critical factor for me The staff at the hotel were very friendly putting in extra effort For example printing out tour tickets for me at reception A special mention to the kind man who took my baggage out of storage and still guarded it while I went to the bathroom These incidents may not seem important but it made a huge difference to me The location is okay I did not explore the nearby area much but it seemed lively and was within walking distance of Place De La Republique Otherwise the stairs to the metro station Gare de L est are literally outside the hotel entrance which makes it so convenient to get around Overall I had a great stay and would definitely recommend this place ,0,181,1
 What extra can I say about this Hilton Hotel It was superb The rooms tastefully decorated with all the space and storage you could want the bathroom facility beautifully done and so clean the bar and the breakfast dining area just perfect Not located right in the centre of Vienna is within easy access to the underground system that know where is out of reach The bi lingual staff were so friendly and helpful I would hesitate to use the term staff they were more like your best friend The breakfast was quite stunning a massive amount of choice and so beautifully presented Unbeatable Breakfast outside right alongside the Danube on a warm summers morning was something to be experienced I know that in the Hilton hotels you get what you pay for but as far as some Hiltons are concerned this was very affordable and reasonably priced It is hard to imagine somewhere better A footnote to the people who work at this Hilton Thank you for making our stay so comfortable and memorable It didn t go unnoticed,0,181,1
 The online reviews I read about this hotel we re nothing in comparison to what it was Any reviews saying the rooms we re small the staff weren t attentive etc Was not experienced by myself what so ever We booked a standard room and were given a key card for a room on the second floor The room had wonderfully quirky decor was spacious and spotlessly clean The staff replaced water coffee tea shampoos and soaps every morning for the room and the service at the front desk and in the restaurant was also attentive and friendly The food by the way was also amazing I recommended other friends to book for a meal even though they weren t staying with us All in all along with the perfect location this hotel was the best I ve stayed in Amsterdam this was my 4th trip I will be booking to stay there on my next visit and would recommend anyone to book And if you can t get in make sure you go for a meal at least ,0,181,1
 We stayed at the hotel as it was close to Parc del Forum for Primavera Festival The cost was quite high which I imagine was due to the location at the time of the festival but it was within walking distance from parc del forum and the beach was a 5 minute walk Lots of little restaurants nearby in Poblonou and the H16 bus was 2 50 and took you all the way to the centre near la ramblas and the Gothic Quarter The rooftop pool and lounge area was perfect and although you had to pay to hire the loungers and beds which we felt was overpriced especially for guests already paying to stay there was plenty of space to lie on bean bags or ground area to lay your towel The rooms were cleaned daily and the hotel was very clean Staff were very attentive and we had a free bottle of cava as we were visiting for our honeymoon Overall a lovely stay and although very expensive it was in the perfect location for the festival ,0,181,1
 The staff couldn t be any more polite helpful and friendly and always go the extra mile to make sure our stay is first class The hotel room itself is spotless clean comfortable and gives and very homely feel The shower is FABULOUS We love this hotel because of its central location and within walking distance of many central London attractions shops bars and restaurants and very easy to get to by taxi from Euston Station It is the little things I notice every time I stay in this hotel like how at least one person on front reception will always greet you when entering or leaving the hotel which all adds to making a stay here that little more special We ate breakfast during our last stay and this is a buffet style full English with a selection of cereals toast fruit etc and very good value for money Having stayed at this hotel a number of times I would highly recommend to anyone if they are looking for a special place to stay whilst visiting central London ,0,181,1
 E V E R Y T H I N G no but seriously I have no words for how amazing this hotel actually is We were speechless when we walked into our room Got to the reception was given complimentary glass of champagne then got told our room was upgraded as it was our anniversary I don t know where to even begin with the room Let s just say it was perfection felt more like our own apartment so cosy so modern absolutely beautiful interior design We had two showers two sinks a massive bathtub a HUGE mirror in the bedroom We had lamps hanging down from the wall which look amazing also had led lights making the bed light up underneath Free movies to watch on the TV and also got complimentary soft drinks from the minibar Oh not to forget the most beautiful spa i have ever seen been in Highly recommend this hotel honestly cannot wait to go back I want to move in It was worth every single penny we paid to stay ,0,180,1
 I went with my boyfriend for my 21st birthday and the hotel couldn t have been nicer The staff were incredibly friendly helpful and nothing was too much to ask The location was perfect half an hours walk to the beach and all the other popular tourist attractions The bus from the airport cost 5 90 and stopped 5 mins from the hotel The strip of designer and high street shops were also on the same road Even though the hotel was on a busy road the room was quite and I had a good night s sleep every night There was also free bottles of water in the rooms mini fridge perfect when foreign water tastes awful compared to our English water haha The decking and pool were always in the sun and in the evenings there is free wine tasting and mini tapas for the guests I couldn t fault the hotel Perfection in an even more perfect city Strongly recommend if you re willing to spend a tiny bit more the money is worth it ,0,180,1
 There is absolutely nothing to complain about We simply loved the spacious room we stayed in it was clean tidy and very comfortable Having a small kitchen with all the necessary utensils was also a great advantage The bed was a bit rough to our taste though but all in all we slept well those long pillows are heaven on Earth The bathroom was also very spacious and great to use there is even a clothesline in the wall if you ever need to dry your clothes A pleasant bonus was L Occitane cosmetics in the bathroom The staff was helpful and friendly with excellent command of English so we had no problem with communication And we greatly enjoyed breakfasts there were lots of various foods meat fish eggs vegs and fruits to choose from great coffee and pastry too so ordering breakfasts there is highly recommended The location is great close to Marina metro station and close enough to all the sights if you enjoy walking WiFi signal was excellent We would definitely choose this hotel again ,0,180,1
 This hotel treated us just in a Royal way We came to London to celebrate my wife s birthday we booked a double room at The Royal Horseguards through the booking com and we were so excited by their attitude to our special occasion First of all they have have precisely fulfilled all special requests a bottle of champagne flowers in the room the bouquet was beautiful all on a very short notice But the main surprise was that they gave us a free upgrade to their Tower Suite Staying in this two floor 270degrees panorama suite is worth of a separate visit to London itself This hotel is a real historical and cultural landmark the building is just magnificent It s location architecture interior and genuine British spirit makes staying in this hotel a unique experience We would like to send our special thanks to James who enabled all this perfect experience and who was very professional super friendly and attentive We enjoyed every second of staying there and we highly recommend it to all travellers ,0,179,1
 It was a really nice experience something very different to the norm You can check in without any interaction and on checkout I was told I could keep my room key as a handy luggage tag and if I go back to a Citizen M again it will recognize me once I swipe it Cool The hotel lobby is amazing it is like a funky library free wifi full of sockets to charge up phones laptops etc I was traveling alone so ate from the self service restaurant and it was excellent quality The staff were really friendly and welcoming and a real asset to the hotel in its start up phase Of course the room is the other attraction as a total Generation Y boy having a Samsung tablet to control the lights and mood the TV music blinds was great fun But if you are not at all at ease with technology there are switches to control the lights and blinds if not the TV The bed was massive considering the size of the room ,0,179,1
 I stayed with sister who uses a wheelchair as she has limited mobility We had booked a standard room however when we arrived the check in staff offered us the option of an adapted room at no extra cost We didn t take them up on this offer only because it wasn t necessary the room we had booked was very spacious I was able to manage with the chair and the shower in the room was easily accessible for my sister During our stay we ate at the hotel restaurant as it was only a short distance we didn t take the wheelchair however a member of staff saw that my sister struggled walking and came over and advised that they had a wheelchair we could use if needed The friendliness of the staff and the assistance they provided from check in to check out was brilliant above and beyond any expectations They even took the time to show me the best routes to places on the tube etc that I would manage with the wheelchair ,0,179,1
 We have very good impression from the hotel All papers were ready when we came and Check in took less than 1 minute Room was clean and nice bed was comfortable and Bathroom was clean and had enough space There were electric kettle and cups in the room And refrigerator Wi Fi is good for smart phones and a little bit slow for the notebook But they have computers and printer in the lobby and on the 8th floor People at the reception were very polite and helpful Our special thanks to Saim Khalil and Christine Krapf they were always very friendly and reacted very fast on all requests Thanks to them we found quick solutions in many situations We forgot a wallet in the hotel we called from the airport and they found it and we returned the wallet without problems So they are also very honest people The hotel is situated close to Westbahnhof and Mariahilfer strasse main shopping street Metro and supermarket is very close We will definitely stay again in Leonardo Hotel Vienna ,0,179,1
 Rooms great size Really nice and good for relaxing after a long day in the city Travel pass is a must we got a 3 day pass and it allowed us to get the train trams metro and bus around the city The public transport is so easy to navigate and the hotel staff we more than helpful with directions I was slightly apprehensive about how far out of the city the hotel was before we arrived however it turned out to be closer than expected and we were happy to be staying a little out of the way for some peace On our final day we asked at reception to print our boarding passes They were really helpful and directed us to a computer room with printer to use free of charge in a lovely lounge We opted out of breakfast but will try this next time we stay as it looked great We are already planning on booking a return trip Don t be put off by any negative reviews this is a great hotel ,0,179,1
 Victor and Marlene helped us so much since our last hotel left one of our bags at the concierge and they drove to pick up our bag so that we could have it before our flight Also Claudia from the front desk was so helpful to us during our stay with directions and recommendations of things to do All the staff were extremely nice and always had a nice demeanor Very respectful and with a smile The hotel really aims to please their guests The room was great It was the grey room and the modern decor is very cool We had complimentary drinks in the mini bar that they restocked every day and the front desk also gave us cold water bottles before we left When we told them we needed to get to the airport by a certain time they ordered the taxi and had it loaded with our bags in advance so when we came back from our walk everything was packed and ready to go We will definitely come back to the Sofitel ,0,179,1
 I travel a lot every few days different hotel and I have to say that NHOW HOTEL IN MILAN is one of the best I have ever visited I have spent there wonderful 5 days from 27 01 17 to 01 02 17 in room 459 Fabulous modern design great location close to the city center bicycles which you can rent delicious food but what is the most important PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE STAFF MEMBER IS SMILING AND HELPFUL They create atmosphere of this place Receptionists who were flexible discussing about room price when I had to extend the reservation day by day The lady who was cleaning my room gave me her own bottle of water when I asked for one because she did not want me to wait The restaurant crew always kind Salwa and Monika who suprised me with goodbye present She knew that Jasmine Green Tea is my favourite so she prepared one for me when I was leaving I am honestly impressed THANK YOU Nhow Hotel crew for making my stay even better ,0,179,1
 My best friend and I had a fantastic stay at Le 123 Sebastopol The theater theme is really fun as there is so much to take in so definitely tour the hotel when you arrive There is even a private movie theater downstairs along with a cute private patio out back We traveled overnight and were exhausted so they checked us in early to catch a nap which was so appreciated The room was adorably decorated Very girly and perfect for us Plus we had a quaint little balcony where we sipped our wine and watched the streets below The area is a little less congested than others but easy to walk or metro to many attractions The best reason to stay at the hotel is definitely the staff They are warm and accommodating My favorite was the late night crew as we were often coming back after hours Serge and Xavier are wonderful and made our stay one we will always remember If you are unsure where to go we absolutely recommend Le 123 Sebastopol ,0,178,1
 Staff are extremely professional courteous and accommodating The cleaning staff kept our shower stall and toilet immaculate emphasis The maids didn t provide us with clean drinking glasses every night but in fairness we could see how the oversight could have been made After the first night they forgot to provide us with a second bedsheet but we didn t care Even considering those things the maids were extremely good and did a very good job All of the staff paid attention to detail The hotel is always clean and staff are extremely courteous and accommodating Our room provided a free smart phone to call back home unlimited as well as local unlimited including data That phone was amazingly helpful When we had a problem with charging our phone the hotel staff solved the problem immediately The hotel gave us a live person wake up call which is so much more amazing than just a discourteous computer ring that touch was an amazing way to end our stay at this hotel Extremely courteous and professional staff ,0,178,1
 Nice clean hotel with very friendly staff Small but perfectly equipped and clean rooms We loved the smartphone with unlimited call and data credit and used it all the time while navigating through the city looking for transport resto sights etc Great breakfast you get to choose between an express breakfast croissant bread at the front of the hotel excellent value for money or a more elaborate and thus slightly more expensive buffet breakfast at the back Great location a 2 mins walk to the Pernety metro station The 14th district is very charming and quiet but still has lots of options for bars resto grocery shopping etc Easily accessible by car there s no parking at the hotel but we rented a parking space just around the corner in Rue d Eure using the ZenPark app and that worked flawlessly I definitely recommend this hotel and right now May 2017 prices are very reasonable though that might change since I understood from the staff that the hotel only just opened a couple of months ago ,0,178,1
 I have worked in the hospitality industry for almost 15yrs and I have stayed in numerous Luxury chain of hotel alike such as the Ritz Jumeirah Marriot and I would say this hotel is at par and has a great value for money perfect view of the canals and best location We stayed there for 3 nights celebrating my daugther s 7th Birthday and they are kind enough to arrange a birthday card and some goodies for the kids I would sincerely send my appreciation to Ms Donna Front Office Manager who ensured our stay is comfy and well and Ms Em and Tatiana who checked us in Mr Fritz who is very lively and took care of breakfast every morning Mr Hasim the concierge and advised us the best places in Amsterdam that is well worth it to visit overall definitely we will come back to Amsterdam in spring and no doubt we will stay again in the Wyndham Apollo hotel this is like our home away from home hats off to the entire team ,0,178,1
 The whole experience was great Although an upmarket hotel you were still made to feel normal and not out of place For us this was a treat for our Anniversary When we booked in we were told that we d been upgraded and when we got to the room there was a bottle of champagne strawberries and chocolate on the table It really made our day The room was big enough comfortable light and airy The bathroom dressing room took our breath away It was huge with his and her sinks a bath with a tv on it which I took full advantage of and plenty of hanging space and drawers for your items The staff at reception were very polite and took their time to explain everything Breakfast options were fab You could choose from a hot menu and also anything at the buffet stations For the money and quality it is worth it The location is great aswell as you are in walking distance of most attractions and shops and also the tube station ,0,178,1
 We absolutely loved our room We had a sixth floor room with a balcony Everything was perfect Very close to Nord train station Neighborhood yes was abit sketchy Would not want to go out late at night but we were so tired out by early evening so we enjoyed our room Paying abit extra for the room with the balcony we had no complaints about the size It was very roomy and clean The staff were excellent and spoke very good english to us We found them very friendly Although we checked out at noon the staff kept our suitcase and allowed us to sit in the outdoor lounge and in the front lobby until it was time to go get the train The night clerk even gave me extra milk at night for our tea and coffee that was in the room After doing alot of research on paris hotels near Nord I am so glad we picked the Hotel Hor No complaints about anything I would not hesitate to book again with them ,0,177,1
 The room was spacious by London standards There was plenty space for my children to potter about The bathrooms were renovated well with a separate toilet which works well with so many people in a room The continental breakfasts were served in a charming pub with a garden conservatory that lifted the spirits in the morning The breakfast fare was sufficient to postcode is with the energy for exporting the city The venue is central to Greenwich with options to walk to Greenwich park Greenwich observatory and planetarium Maritime museum and the Cutty Sark It is also near the DLR station running to London The room has a fan for hot summer days and the windows open for fresh air The beds were comfortable The pub downstairs had entertainment for weekends which they did warn us about I rested well anyway after a hard day s walking in London In addition the building is a historical UNESCO recognised site and borders a historical church I thoroughly enjoyed the visit Historical practical perfect for my trip ,0,177,1
 I would like to talk with travellers with head on their shoulders and feet really on the floor There are so many hotels in Paris but when you exclude the very expensive ones the big chains hotels not very exciting the bad ones then you have the good hotels good location reasonable price small good service We find one in Paris 17 LES JARDINS DE LA VILLA SPA Everything perfect starting with the manager STEPHANE une perle rare the receptionist NICOLAS he knows his job and he is doing it perfectly and all the remaining staff The decoration of the hotel itself and the rooms particularly is amazing Breakfast is very good and served in a very different manner than other hotels It s really the place to be in Paris mainly due to the location the calm little street proximity of main center of Paris very good restaurants around Room 22 was a very good choice but I guess all numbers will satisfy the most difficult Go there it s a very good choice ,0,177,1
 The breakfast was nice and had a decent selection to accommodate anyone Gluten free rolls were available if you ask server The area to get to the buffet is very congested and annoying Good location for access to Centrale station 200m but a bit far from most attractions Done up well average furnishings and finishes with each floor decorated in a different colour scheme Big bathroom and bathtub Staff was professional and polite And every staff member greeted us when we walked by There was a mix of guests Plenty of tourists and tourists with kids Did see quite a few gentlemen with their nieces which was unexpected We had booked online for 3 nights and asked to check out early after day 2 but were told that we would be charged for the 3rd night Thought that was a bit rough since we had already stayed and paid for 2 nights I would not choose this venue upon another visit to Milan as it does not suit us But I could recommend to friends ,0,177,1
 Anytime my Partner and I travel to Barcelona we stay at this hotel As per on previous occasions we have never been disappointed in any way The hotel is spotlessly clean airconditioning in all rooms which are also extremely large and very comfortable The bathroom is very large and has both bath and shower facilities therein also a seating area which for anybody staying here who may have a disability is very convenient and safe Across the road there is a very good restaurant where you can enjoy anything from a coffee to a full meal or a drink Down the tree lined road you have the cafes and restaurants which serve fabulous food and wine expecially the Tapas The Beach and Harbour are only five minutes walk from the hotel If you don t fancy a trip to the beach then you have a Solarium on the roof of the hotel with a marvelous view of Barcelona There is plenty of seating area available and Sun Umbrellas for those of us with fair skin ,0,177,1
 Always coming back to this place every time when visiting Amsterdam quality guaranteed Very comfortable and spacious rooms unlikely for Amsterdam hotels Various and delicious breakfast with a stunning view on Amsterdam from the 17th floor Nice helpful and pleasant stuff that welcomes you warmly at the reception desk that your travel just can t start badly The area is close to amazing Rembrandtpark which is suitable for training run walks or just chill out For those who are keen on exploring the city you can go on foot to Voldenpark and Rijksmuseum in half an hour but also in very front of the hotel there is a tram stop that takes you directly to Dam Central Station in 15 minutes Finally if you like to rest and enjoy in quiet evenings hotel has truly good sound proof insulation so good that you can oversleep your clock alarm But for those who would like to party the bar on the 17th floor and roof top when open offer various of chill out and party amusement ,0,177,1
 I got stranded in London due to Eurostar cancellation after Brussels attacks and got lucky suites were 60 per cent off here and I got the last one a two bedroom suite for 71 pounds literally next to St Pancras Staff welcomed me and took very good care of me which was needed in the circumstances I ve put a instead of a D on price quality based on their normal prices because the price I got was definitely a D but it was 60 per cent off And then a instead of a D for the breakfast which wasn t bad at all but also not stellar perhaps a recent trip to France spoiled me for the croissants and baked goods But it was all decent and a good variety of things to choose from They were kind enough also to let me eat early due to early check in for extra securty checks The home I needed during two stressfull days I would definitely come again here with my family for leisure ,0,176,1

 The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries ,0,175,1
 I want to highlight the support received by the Front Desk responsible Alexandre and the BEST Babysitter EVER Charlotte We planned to be in Paris for the Coldplay show We originally were my wife my 12yo daugther and myself In the last minute we had to change a little bit our plans and bring to Paris also our 3yo boy I asked for a Babysitter service to take care of our boy during the afternoon of the show not an easy thing considering that he is always sticked around his mother and he only manage to speak his very particular Spanish Alexandre made the arrangements to have the Fabulous Charlotte in charge and the result was OUTSTANDING A very BIG THANKS Charlotte and Alexandre Without your assistance our plan to attend to this fantastic show in Paris wouldn t be possible I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL FOR FAMILIES On a logistic aspect the metro station Mouton Duvernet is just crossing the street and you can get any place in the city from there ,0,175,1
 Was the best hotel out of our entire trip The room was so spacious and comfortable The breakfast was great just enough to get you started in the morning to go out all day An added bonus of the cocktail hour and the afternoon tea time int he lounge as well The staff themselves were simply wonderful There was one concierge that was so helpful to us while we were that it truly made the whole experience that much better since we didn t have to worry about getting tickets for tours or anything He even remembered the fact that we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday after just one mention of it They gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate that night plus a little note It was the little stuff that made us love this hotel We will not be staying anywhere else when we go back to Amsterdam An added bonus is that they are right there next to everything we never had to walk too far to go somewhere ,0,175,1
 Great staff and lovely breakfast We were especially keen on the make your own waffles yummy Only thing i can criticise is I booked the room 6 months before and ordered a deluxe double and we requested a high room with a view When we arrived to check in the reception were telling everyone that the rooms were not ready so they were upgrading us to a better room The room was a twin it was our anniversary and was smelly and on the bottom floor We were very disappointed and went to complain To be fair to the reception they did find us a better room but we saw and spoke to several others that were not so lucky As I say the reception did handle matters eventually but we did have to make a fuss Apart from that it was a great stay loved the facilities and the location lots of great places around the hotel that are much more Dutch than central Amsterdam and we enjoyed that Have a good stay,0,175,1
 La Tamise was wonderful It was conveniently located near the Louvre and the Jardin de Tuileries both within a 5 10 minute walk The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming especially Pierre He went out of his way to make us comfortable and to help us enjoy our stay We even enjoyed fun conversation with him over coffee and champagne We miss him and his hospitality already My husband and I didn t book a room with a view but we didn t miss it as we spent so much time sight seeing outside of the room It was small but not too cramped The room was also extremely clean and nicely decorated The bed was very comfortable The espresso machine and fixings in the room were convenient for those mornings when you needed some energy before getting out the door Definitely recommend this hotel be sure to take advantage of the advice and knowledge of the hotel staff Pierre as they ll be honest and provide good recommendations Book this now ,0,174,1
 We stayed in the hotel at the end of August beginning September 2015 in 2 different kind of rooms a double room and a suit borth of them were excellent have a new design and let me presume they are innovative as a lot of things you could find in the Netherlands Easy to reach the hotel as from Schiphol as from the Centraal Station People who are working at the reception are attentive and know their work the same I could say about the persons who are cleaning the rooms everyday new towels and linens And linens are of best quality good to touch and to sleep Though we didn t take breakfast we could say that this is well done a pleasant smell near the breakfast area every morning And finally but not the last all what we have seen and experienced while our staying in West Cord Art Hotel this is in the main part thank to a professional work of General manager and stuff a very friendly hotel ,0,174,1

 We booked the Hotel da Vinci for the final night of our two week honeymoon in Europe We had been staying mostly in B Bs and decided to splurge on a fancy hotel for the last night of our trip It was so worth it The hotel was beautiful and the service was excellent We booked some time in the pool for the afternoon of our arrival and enjoyed it so much that we booked additional time the next morning The neighborhood is lively and very interesting to walk around and there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby We chose to go directly next door to Saint P res Fleurs picerie and purchased food to go so that we could enjoy it in our lovely room While the hotel was certainly more expensive than our other accommodations it was well worth it to spend our final night in Europe living luxuriously The front desk staff were helpful accommodating and incredibly attentive to detail We would absolutely recommend staying here ,0,172,1
 Last week we spent 5 remarkable days in Paris One of components of tremendous short rest is a cozy guest house practically and the center Paris Hotel du Ministere Day personnel on a reception the most sociable customer oriented good natured and sympathetic I ve got detailed answers to all my questions as it is better to pass or far more simply to reach And all that were easy with smile from their side The hotel is perfectly located we practically went by walked to all sightseeings Room number is very pure was cleaned perfectly every day Number was Deluxe with extraordinary planning Hotel is located not so far from Police we were safe Many thanks to Hotel s Administration to young people on reception black and fair haired sorry I don t know their names for the wonderful attitude towards guests P S Its too pity for me that I tasted croissants on breakfast in the hotel only last day of my visit They were delicious and especially french ,0,172,1

 The hotel is an easy metro ride from the centre and is located in a quiet residential neighbourhood so no night time noise There are interesting tourist sites nearby if a change of pace is needed from the crowds in the city centre We were in a spacious attic room with a superb bathroom with views to the Norman Foster communications tower and the Parc Tibidabo from the shower There was an outside seating area on the roof for the attic rooms as well as a small garden downstairs where meals can be taken We didn t use the pool area but it looked a great place to relax on warmer days The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent We loved the comfy lounge with honesty bar where we made our own gin and tonics before heading out to eat Free coffee is available all day in the library computer room It is well worth being outside the city centre to stay at this quirky hotel,0,172,1
 The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and spacious Larger than the average UK chain hotel There was a mini bar which kept some of our supplies cool If you stay more than one night there is an option not to have the room cleaned and to claim a free drink each at the bar instead There was a lovely terrace and grassed outdoor seating area in which to have said drink Almost opposite was a Billa supermarket which was well presented and had a lovely choice of food and drink An Aldi was also located about 100 metres in the opposite direction The location was also just a few minutes walk from the underground station and also convenient for the Danube waterfront The hotel room brochure recommended a place to eat which although we were dubious about trying was really good It was about a 20 minute walk but worth it for a very authentic pub bar with reasonably priced food and the option for eating inside or out ,0,172,1
 When we walked into the room soft music was playing setting a nice ambience Within 5 minutes of being in our room the front desk called to ask if everything was to our liking The breakfast included with the room was an amazing variety of foods including eggs cooked to order not just made to order omelets but also poached eggs or any other type of egg pretty much anything one could want whether craving a European style breakfast or an American style breakfast The aromatherapy kit of essential oils with properties that aid with relaxation was a nice and unique touch The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable We ordered room service for dinner one night and the food came quickly and was excellent One of the dishes we ordered was the beef carpaccio it was delicious and the waiter said they are so well known for their beef carpaccio that people come from outside the hotel to have it The location was an easy walk to the tram ,0,172,1
 It s a very new hotel in East Docklands of Amsterdam The district has a modern architecture U can reach the city center with the tram Nr 10 and in 15 20 min u can be at Leidseplein If u r coming from Amsterdam Central u should t be worried either the tram Nr 26 brings u here also Just 3 min walking from both tram stop to the hotel Our room was nice incl breakfast The breakfast is good and delicious If u get hungry later on u can order pizza or other dishes for reasonable price We extended our stay in the hotel so it was offered for us a fidelity card of Hampton by Hilton which made our extended night a bit cheaper The hotel has 100 Satisfaction Guarantee We had some minor observation to improve the service and at end of or stay the we got some more discount from the amazingly helpful staff It was a a very pleasant stay in this hotel Very recommendable ,0,172,1
 I like the location and the facilities also room size was very spacious worth the money very clean comfortable bed and bathroom very clean I was speechless I recommend it to the north south east and west of the WORLD good excellent breakfast and service 10 we were celebrating my husband and my self 50th they treated us really well when it came to the booking well informed and well sorted for any issue which was on my side I could not believe the swimming sauna and gym room I go there 10x again and if to pay more I will worth it husband Mikey face lit up when he saw what was available to him I could not believe i rang back to Reading and told my friends and family so much that I was willing to pay for them to stay there too I will definitely be BACK WORDS CAN NOT DESCRIBE NOTHING BAD ABOUT THE PLACE I CAN FAULT HOW DARE DOES ANYONE COMPLAIN SEE ME ,0,171,1
 Out of the ordinary hotel with a small swimming pool at the roof just refreshing and a small gym with all state of the art machines one of each training machines plus free water and towels round the corner from the metro tube station 2 streets away from the main street Paseg Gracia with all the offices if you are here to work and all the tourist attractions such as the Gaudi houses if you are in as a visitor Great spot as the location gives easy access to both local restaurants if you look for the taste of real home made They have fast track check in at the hotel and the level of service is out of the ordinary to make you feel at home even if it s the first time you just pop in There are free drinks and coffee maker a coffee maker rather than a kettle at the room and the beds are really comfortable This is now my preferred spot in Barcelona ,0,171,1
 I had read other peoples reviews some great some not I have got to say although this cost me an absolute fortune it was worth every penny to see my mums face light up I had booked this as a early Xmas present for my mum me and a friend the staff where amazing I have never known such attention to detail friendly attentive and brilliant food was great and they where able to accommodate my allergies easily with plenty of choice The staff where very easy going and ready for a chat and a laugh not stuffy or miserable as lead to believe by some of the reviews the room was lovely and clean and the beds where so comfy I slept the best I had slept in ages The only downside is the drinks are very expensive but the memories we are left with are priceless I would recommend this to anyone wanting to create a lasting memory for a family member or friend Go treat yourself,0,170,1
 The room was a wonderful surprise when we walked in very spacious beautifully decorated which goes for the entire hotel best hotel bed I ve ever slept in and big bathroom with a great shower The staff was very friendly and always keen to help with any questions be it about the room or about food recommendations in the city When you arrive before check in or want to explore the city some more after checking out they safely store your luggage at the reception for as long as you want The tram station where you can take trams to Sloterdijk station and to the city centre is only a 5 minute walk away Even though there are no breakfast facilities and mini bar yet the hotel easily compensated this by offering two free drinks in the bar next door a breakfast deal in a nearby espressobar and coffee tea water and some snacks in the room so this didn t bother us at all Would certainly recommend ,0,170,1
 The staff at this hotel excels any that we have met in other hotels Staff at Aloft have fantastic customer service skills that go beyond the extra mile This is our second time we have booked this hotel The staff are more than happy to meet your requests at any time during your stay This what hospitality is about providing a excellent service Aloft exceeds this service All other chains should take note of this hotel The hotel was pristine in all departments We were a party of eight four adults four children and the facilities including the pool were highly appreciated The Restaurant and shop were very good value and the range of food excellent The car parking to the Docklands Railway a few mins walk from hotel was so convenient The location of the hotel next to London Excel and overlooks the River Thames Overall our short stay was thoroughly enjoyed and have already planned our next stay Thank you to all the staff at Aloft London,0,170,1
 Stayed with parents in a Triple Room The rooms are not very spacious the bathroom is big and nice and includes all amenities but are clean with comfy beds and linens It is also well equipped with tea coffee facilities in room Air con works very good The staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel is clean Location is excellent as its just a stones throw away from La Ramblas Hop on Hop off bus and the metro Around the area there are wide variety of restaurants bars shops within walking distance There is a Starbucks right opposite the hotel and there is a Vodaphone just about 2 mins walk from the hotel It is a short distance from the airport and should not cost more than 30 euros Spa gym and pool access included but unfortunately did not have the time to enjoy them It was a short but lovely stay and I would recommend this hotel Ask for a room with a pool view ,0,170,1
 Brilliant buffet breakfast well worth the 14 Junior suite room was perfect and even had our own little rooftop terrace Location right next door to sondrio underground station literally 5 mins to duomo centre Hotel was 2 minutes walk from Milan centrale station again ideal transfers from malpensa airport Staff were excellent helpful and friendly I made them aware it was my girlfriends birthday before booking they included free breakfast for us both and put a box of chocolates with a message in our room to wish her a happy birthday I also think they gave us free additions from the mini bar on her birthday as they didn t charge us Couldn t fault anything about the hotel room clean modern spacious with everything you could need even free robes and slippers The sauna and steam room was lovely also and included within the stay Wifi was consistently good throughout Will definitely recommend both Milan as a city and this hotel to my friends thinking of going ,0,170,1
 Hotel Mentana is the best deal in Milan Set just off a usually quiet square you re in old Milan just a couple of cobblestoned streets away from the main streets and a pleasant 15 minute walk to Doumo Sure the hotel isn t the newest or flashiest but that s part of its charm Doors open with big keys the lobby is full of polished wood and features the sort of little bar you might find in a movie from the 1950s and the breakfast well it s ok and enough You haven t come to Milan for your hotel breakfast Stay here sleep well have a coffee a croissant then head out across the square and go sit in one of the many cafes in the area for another coffee before your day of exploration For currently under 100 Euro a night for a single room right in the center of Milan seriously you can t go wrong with the Hotel Mentana Friendly helpful staff too ,0,170,1
 The room is very clean big bed is very comfy has a nice balcony and amazing big bathroom In terms of room I would rate as one of the best in Paris Location not my personal favorite it s a 20 minute nice walk to all the fancy shops and nice restaurants Breakfast very limited options staff were friendly but not very accommodating Asked for restaurant reservations before arrival and they confirmed during check in at the restaurants they didn t find our reservations We arrived at around 8pm next morning asked for late checkout they said they needed the room asap but when tried booking online or through booking their were rooms available for a new hotel I would not have done that I would give it another try if the rates stay the same right now it s very much value for money 300 Euros night including breakfast but maybe this is because they just opened if they raise the prices I would stay elsewhere ,0,169,1
 I stayed here with my mum for a night as I was switching apartments The room was very clean the beds comfortable and the staff incredibly polite and helpful The hotel is located in a nice neighbourhood although a bit more modern not the classic Hausmann architecture if you care about that sort of thing well connected to some of the major tourist attraction by metro or just a walk It s great for its proximity to the Montparnasse tower where you can get a great view of Paris Eiffel tower included Overall we really enjoyed our stay We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet so if you can select a deal that has it included might not be a bad idea Bonus point s You get a beautiful view of the Eiffel tower just around the corner of the hotel And in front if you are a looking for a nice typical Parisian bistro dinner the Cafe Ernest is a good choice at a fairly reasonable price ,0,169,1

 we flew down from Aberdeen for 2 days in London for a concert after a very short 5 minute walk from Ealing Common Underground Station we arrived at the Hotel about 12pm which was 2 hours earlier than the Booking in time stipulated but the staff were friendly welcoming and allowed us to book in early which enabled us to spend the rest of the afternoon exploring London without carrying unnecessary baggage The room showers Toilet was clean and bright with manually controlled air conditioning we were able to sleep in a comfortable cool environment in a day of high temperature Got back to the Hotel late in the evening and enjoyed a couple of drinks in the quiet Hotel bar Breakfast was just like most Hotels English style buffet Breakfast with eggs to order staff were quick with service can t fault them Overall i enjoyed the stay was quiet clean comfortable with helpful friendly staff that s all i wanted from my short stay ,0,168,1
 Excellent location but very very hard to find as the address given is not for the street where the doors open onto You must walk behind to find the entry Very strange Great staff overlooking the main street so easy shopping Supermarket at the end of the street turn right out of the entry doors walk in the middle of the road and straight into supermarket which serves breakfast Atm machines everywhere Hop on bus the best option as a large distance to walk to all attractions we didn t take and missed some sights guess we will have to return hehe Great truffles Shop carefully wrapped them for us and we posted them home with fantastic help from the Post Shop about 5 min walk from hotel they arrived in New Zealand in 5 days in excellent condition We classed them as a letter even though they were in a Post cardboard box as the weight of the box was still in the letter class ,0,168,1
 The hotel is in a good location in the East of Amsterdam It s easy to reach from the centre of town take tram 26 from Centraal Station only 3 stops The river Ij is a nice 5 10 minute walk away with 2 supermarkets Albert Heijn and Jumbo easily located for all you day to day essentials There is also a nice tapas restaurant Pata Negra beside the river which has good food and a good atmosphere The hotel has a 24 hour menu handy as I arrived late in Amsterdam and most shops were closed The 24 hour menu is a little limited but handy for a late night snack or if you are a late arriver I ve stayed in other branches of Hampton by Hilton and this branch did not disappoint The bed was super comfy and the room was immaculately cleaned daily The reception staff were very approachable and friendly I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again ,0,168,1
 I stayed here with my husband and one year old for 4 days As we had a big suite it was more than enough space and convenient for us plus we loved how quiet it was It would have been ideal for my husband and I to have one bed to ourselves instead of 2 small beds side by side It was very clean and lovely decor The proximity of the hotel to major tourist attractions was great and loved that all metro stations have lifts which makes it easy when you have a pushchair We only had breakfast every day at the hotel and maybe a bigger variety of things everyday at the buffet would have been nice different cheeses and more fruit selection no bananas and decaffeinated tea or coffee for those that require it The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and helpful and accommodated us easily Overall we are quite pleased with this hotel and would return in the future ,0,168,1
 Located just behind St Stephen s Cathedral and from there within walking distance of the State Opera house and museums it gave us quick access to the most important attractions in Vienna without having to take taxi or public transport Our room was a duplex and the kids simply loved their upstairs room with its own bathroom spacious lounge and tv The ambience is truly Austrian with furnishings to match Beds were very comfortable better than our orthopaedic bed back home The bathrooms are modern well lit and updated to rival 5 star hotels anywhere in the world Breakfast was a delight and they cook to order based on the menu Staff were courteous and friendly Air conditioning was very good Although there is room service an in room automatic kettle would be a nice addition to make instant coffee for ourselves We truly enjoyed our stay in Hotel K nig von Ungarn so much so that my kids had a difficult time leaving the room ,0,168,1
 Very modern and quiet We choose our hotel for its proximity to the Main Train Station It is a little away from the main city centre but lots of transport and about a 20 min walk Travel tip make sure you get a public transport pass as the ticket box on the trams only take coin and we didnt have any The Yellow bus is amazing and has 5 different routes I wouldnt recommend paying the extra for a Vienna Pass as you will never be able to spend the time exploring each stop Just choose and pay for the stops you want to do 2 of the routes took 2 hours without us getting off at any stops due to limited time Wonderful overview of Vienna if you only have a couple of day Look out for the dedicated cycle paths everywhere throughout the City as they cycle with speed Love the way everyone gets out into the Parks with the warm start to summer ,0,168,1
 Very friendly staff always here to help and assist you All our requests were fulfilled fast and with smile additional bottles of water ironing desk even helping with our flight registration The Gym facilities are 24 hours 7 days a week open even on the night from the 31 12 to 01 01 In SPA and Gym areas everything is super clean and tidy lots of space and not so many people even in peak times Breakfast excellent buffet selection pastries cheeses fruit berries and vegetables cereals etc When arriving ask for a menu on hot dishes And don t be shy to tell the waiter you allergies or simple food preferences all the staff is very friendly and understandable The room is perfectly cleaned twice a day The soundproofing in the room is excellent The mini bar is included in the room price and the selection is good The hotel is ideally situated close to everything places of interest shopping streets and the train station ,0,168,1
 The location cannot be beat The staff was extremely accommodating and polite but if you ask a question to the wrong person they are immediately going to tell you that they don t answer that particular question and you should ask the next person I made the mistake of asking the concierge for a question that the check in person was to answer only to be reminded by him that he was the concierge it was not his responsibility to answer the question and to ask another person at the desk All I asked was whether I should dial o before the number in Paris In addition depending on who you have seating you in the restaurant they are either adamant that they will serve you breakfast or that you should get up yourself as it is a self serve All in all the location is amazing as you can walk everywhere The cleanliness can t be beat and I would certainly book there again ,0,167,1
 Such a comfortable stay The pillows were superb We stayed in the Juniour suite and it was such a beautiful and very spacious room It had a free standing bath tub which was amazing The shower was also fantastic The mini bar was also free apart from the champagne There was a docking station which we played music at The hotel is very artistic and has a great vibe especially for young people The staff were all amazing and very helpful It was my boyfriend s birthday so they even left him a card in the room The breakfast was great if you re searching for a quick and cheap breakfast It included French food too The hotel has a gym but we didn t attend The location is very much in central but it was tucked away from everything It wasn t that much of a problem especially for people who want to return to some peace and quiet Fantastic hotel definitely worth the money,0,167,1
 Went with a girlfriend who was visiting from the states The customer service provided from the staff was one of the best I ve ever experienced We were given information for all kinds of things an outstanding high end restaurant the address to an English bookstore hours to the Jimmy Choo store storing boob milk I was pumping storing my milk in the fridge but on the last day our train wasn t leaving until the late afternoon and then when we came back I wanted to pump one last time before boarding the train but the spacious public bathrooms at the hotel didn t have any plug ins so when I told the concierge he set me up in an actual room for privacy and comfort Now if that isn t service I have no idea what is My husband found the hotel and did all the research so he set it up for us Now I understand why they are rated so high ,0,167,1
 The staff all of them spoke good English and helpful All the Receptionists gave us a good impression always going the extra mile to ensure we were assisted to our satisfaction The breakfast was good although it was the same everyday which can be boring in a way Maybe they can change the menu once in a while There is a nice sitting area where coffee is available on the ground floor The Hotel depends on the honesty of the Guests to pay for the drinks which is a cool thing It is close to all the sights Rijksmuseum Van Gough food etc and if you take UberX from the central station But you can easily take the tram to get there for Euro 2 90 With Uber it only cost you EURO 17 or less Location is fantastic as the Airport Express Bus is within 5 minutes walk from the Hotel It is the Rijksmuseum stop for both the Tram and the Airport Express ,0,167,1
 Excellent hotel in a great location Would highly recommend it to anyone Within walking distance to lots of bars restaurants and easy access to metro and bus stops to get to the sights slightly further away Staff very friendly nothing was too much to ask Hotel is a in a lovely area much nicer restaurants near the hotel than in Las Ramblas where you pay for the location and poorer quality food easy to walk to this area if you wish Would recommend visiting La Bouqeria market in Las Ramblas Got a taxi to the airport which costs around 30 euros and takes about 20 minutes well worth it Roof top bar quite expensive as expected but lovely views Rooftop pool is an added bonus to the hotel We didn t have breakfast in the hotel so can t comment on that but loads of restaurants cafes close by to grab breakfast Would definitely stay in this hotel again if we came back to Barcelona ,0,167,1
 I ve stayed in this hotel just for overnight Checked in around 6 7pm and had to check out no later than 3 15 am So my expectations weren t high while creating my reservation but my experience was even way more that what I d expect for a long stay I ve have been greeted with a nice smile and a warm welcome I ve been given a room update next thing which was looking better and bigger than what I ve seen on reservation Free of charge things placed within the room were really kind and was a nice jesture Finally although the room had something being forgotton before my stay I ve been informed that I ve forgotton something in the room which increased my trust to the hotel Now I know if next time I stay there and forget something I would be informed by the hotel Next time I come to Milano now I know where I ll be staying ,0,167,1
 Great location a stone s throw from Warren Street tube station and 2mins walk to Euston Booked a single room to stay over to join friends for a SOHO night out and have the convenience of getting to London St Pancras the next morning Room was clean and nicely decorated bathroom compact but clean and well stocked Room had traffic noise as it was facing the front road so I called reception to ask to move rooms They sorted it straight away I explained I was in a rush to get ready to meet friends He told me to carry on getting ready and brought a new key for my quiet room which meant I could move my stuff when I had finished and dash straight out to the station Great service Free wifi and complimentary bottled water in rooms Breakfast was included and was a good hot buffet Staff efficient and smiled For under 200 I felt like I had a good deal ,0,166,1
 My partner and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights from December 27th Staff were really friendly and nothing was too much trouble They recommend nice places to eat and places to visit The VIP pass to the Westfield centre was also a bonus They also offered to keep hold of our luggage when we checked out so we didn t have to carry it around London Rooms were exceptionally clean and beds were comfy Each room came with its own private wifi and a good selection of tv channels We did not have breakfast here however the staff allowed us to order a Chinese takeaway to the hotel for the first night The hotel is a 5 minute walk away from Stratford station and it takes roughly 25 30 minutes on the tube to reach central London The hotel was good value for money My partner and I both agreed that we would stay here again if we were to revisit London ,0,166,1
 Adorable For American expectations it is a small room but the space was used so well and beautiful proof bigger isn t always better There are larger rooms but it was just me and there was really no need The staff was so nice helping me understand how to get to Versailles very easy to get to with a Metro stop very near by and printing documents The location is about a 10 min walk to Notre Dame and with shops and place to eat along the way as well as close to St Germaine with more shopping and restaurants You might be nervous about not speaking French but everyone at the front desk spoke English I don t normally write review but it was so perfect I knew I was going to come home and write one Did I mention it was adorable Oh and I was slow to understand the theme Le Lapin Blanc when I did I loved it even more ,0,166,1
 The Mirror was central to all attractions shops etc The staff were friendly and very helpful in booking excursions giving directions etc The beds are really comfy best I ve ever slept on whilst on holiday If you like a shower rather than a bath remember to ask on booking as my room had bath with a shower attachment where as our friends room had a walk in shower that was more like a jet wash but what I would have preferred had I been given the option although having said that after pounding the pavements of Barcelona a hot foamy bath was very relaxing Breakfast I felt was overpriced and was mainly continental hence we booked bed only and went next door during our stay to a lovely restaurant where they fell over backwards to get as close to a full English as possible Overall an enjoyable trip and I wouldn t hesitate to return to the Mirror WHEN I return to Barcelona ,0,166,1
 The offset building to the hotel was quite noisy at during the night due to the people partying in the narrow alley Technical personell working on the room nextdoor were not doing anything to be quite draging chairs over the floors talking loud on the phone just outside my door very early in the morning etc The room was excellent but they offered us a new room the night after inside the hotel and yes it was both quite and nice It was the breakfastpersonell that raised the question if they could do anything to improve our stay obviously the tech personell had reported to management that I had told them off with the phone episode that itself is very professional if you do something wrong and report yourself Thats respect to them good job no hard feelings The best part was the amazing breakfast you need to experience it Don t think anymore just book this hotel if it is within your budget ,0,166,1
 We stayed at the hotel at the end of October and had a family room as we had our 15 year old daughter with us The hotel is in an excellent location on the Heren Gracht canal and is ideally placed for walking to all the attractions and has an abundance of local smart bars and cafes The hotel staff were very warm and welcoming from the minute we arrived We stayed in room 63 which was on the 3rd floor and had stunning views over the canal The room was a good size but obviously made smaller by the fact we had another bed in the room However it was well decorated and had a superb modern bathroom The room had a mini bar but sadly no coffee or tea making facilities in the room although the hotel does have 24 hour room service The free Wi Fi had excellent speed We can t recommend this hotel enough and would gladly stay again ,0,166,1

 It is the best location you can walk to most of the attractions The staff provided excellent services most helpful and always with a smile Thank you Kenia and Joan for your wonderful services The hotel is spotless very tastefully decorated The rooms are good size we had 3 rooms the ones facing the street are bigger and have a balcony with a nice view The double glass windows kept the noise out The free snack bar 2 pm to midnight is actually at the hotel s breakfast dinning area tables were always set with napkins and cutlery also many varieties of beverage and snacks to choose from an oasis after long and busy day tours McDonald Starbucks supermarket pharmacy and family restaurant are just a few doors away Hop on off buses are 2 blocks from the hotel My family enjoyed our 3 night stay at this wonderful boutique hotel and highly recommend it to all travelers visiting Barcelona Everything is just excellent ,0,166,1
 Hotel Berna is a dream Fabulous efficient and friendly staff well appointed rooms and the most convenient location one can imagine Both the breakfast and the aperitivo were delicioso and generous This trip was a graduation gift for my daughter and it was welcome to find a hotel that offered a room with two comfortable beds my daughter really doesn t like sharing a bed While a common option here in the states we found it rare in Italy The other hotel options in this price range were far inferior from what I saw and read I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone really a gem I read on another site that someone wrote this was a sketchy neighborhood and I beg to differ Due to a train reservation glitch we arrived after midnight and walked the short distance to the hotel on our own felt completely safe It is a diverse neighborhood so if that scares you I don t know ,0,166,1
 Location of Hotel is ideal for sightseeing and seeing the city We stayed in a room with a balcony and view and had full view of the arc de triomphe and the eiffel tower at a distance beautiful sights when lit up at night from the comfort of our room Room was warm and comfortable and there was nothing I could complain about There is a main metro station practically right outside the door which allowed us to travel the whole city Staff were very friendly at the front desk and helped us alot with showing us on maps how to get places on the metro Staff at front desk also went out of their way to help me when I had trouble with tickets to disneyland They were very patient and did all they could to assist in the situation which worked out in the end Overall a very pleasant experience in the Belfast and would go back again to stay there ,0,165,1
 I arrived at 2am and the front desk staff were friendly welcoming and got me checked in very quickly I got the direct coach from Stansted Airport to Stratford and it was a short walk over the bridge to the hotel The room was nicely decorated and comfortable a bit chilly but the temperature controls were easy to manage I was able to order room service from the limited 24hr menu The bed was really comfortable the room was quiet and it had a lovely bathroom with a decent shower There were a couple of dark grey streaks on one of the white bath towels that looked like mascara but apart from that it was spotless Check out in the morning was quick and efficient and I was able to leave my case with the concierge on the ground floor for the day too It s in a great location within Westfield a very short walk from Stratford station and the Olympic Park ,0,165,1
 This gorgeous little hotel is situated right next to the Pantheon but feels like a quiet respite from the busy streets of Paris From the moment you step in the door you can tell that much care has been taken in decorating and furnishing this hotel There are so many lovely touches throughout the common areas and the guest rooms From the beamed ceilings to the rotary phones and other decor our rooms were beautiful and charming The bathrooms are very modern super clean and comfortable The bed was wonderful And we appreciated the air conditioning Breakfast served in the stone walled cellar was delightful Truly the best scrambled eggs I have ever had The hotel backs up to a quiet neighborhood with a number of restaurants cafes and patisseries that we really enjoyed Last but not least the staff at reception and throughout the hotel were so gracious and friendly We look forward to returning to the Hotel Les Dames du Pantheon ,0,165,1
 Amazing views from our corner suite on the 22nd floor booked to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary There was a so much space we could have easily lived there very comfortably Panoramic views from both bedroom and living room Beds and pillows were super comfy as was the sofa in the living room Was worth paying extra to get this experience Hotel had decorated our bed with rose petals and provided us with a glass of bubbly and chocolates along with a congratulatory note A lovely touch Staff in hotel were very friendly and polite Our anniversary meal in the panoramic restaurant on the 23rd floor was perfect Food was beautiful and waiting staff were attentive without being intrusive Hotel is in a perfect location with easy access to the train station and metro Would recommend buying a T10 ticket Overall a perfect way to celebrate our Ruby Anniversary in a lovely hotel in a beautiful city Would definitely stay at this hotel again,0,165,1
 The room was great Excellent value considering we got a double deluxe in a deal It was hugely spacious luxury sexy interior and a huge amazingly comfortable bed with floor to ceiling windows that meant you could look out over the city The mini bar was also complementary and all the staff were very helpful not that we needed much help I was a bit wary of how far away from the centre of Vienna it would be but it was absolutely not an issue the trains are so simple to co ordinate and you are a 2 minute walk from the nearest station just a few minutes from town We did visit the bar 57 at the end of our Saturday night which had great cocktails and was quite busy with music and a bar club feel I would undoubtedly recommend this hotel it delivers what it says and is a little bit of luxury for excellent value in a beautiful city ,0,165,1
 The bathroom was cleaned every single day and well Decent linen Room a bit small perhaps but there was a storage area where our suitcases could be kept The only fly in the ointment was an attendant in the Exexcutive dining room who was consistently rude to me not to all guests And that our safe seemed to be tampered with when an error message came up and we could not open it We had used it successfully up to then the on duty engineer had to sort it out Later on when we checked out we discovered that an envelope with 300GBP was missing We did not report it as we did not think that there was anything which could be done at that point But we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and the big favor they did by having my hat delivered to me which I had forgotten in my haste to leave for our son s wedding on Saturday 28th May,0,165,1
 I liked that there was a small gym and sauna and a laundry room should you need to do a load or two I didn t use the gym facilities but did monopolize the washers and dryers Knowing that these are here may help some when considering just how much clothes you really need I liked that there was a small kitchen as well but with all the terrific food out in town I wouldn t have even thought about cooking It s a good location to use as your base camp The trains and subways are close but the ability to walk around the city can t be beat Despite the cold in March I am glad I toured by foot Staff were the friendliest people around and were available 24 7 Do not hesitate to stay here Plus the rooms are good sizes compared to other hotels in Europe I would stay here again is the best compliment I can pay ,0,165,1
 Staff were happy to help from the offset We was asked for preference of floor to stay on and we was catered for straight away The room was clean and tidy and had a great view of the Thames We had dinner at the Scoff and Banter at the hotel service again could not of been topped it was prompt and staff again so friendly made you relax We ordered room service for our breakfast for 07 30 usually you would expect a few minutes over specified time but as it 07 30 the door went and we was served a wonderful array of fruits l fresh juice pastries hot drinks and a full English breakfast We left the room to check out and every member of the staff in the hallways cleaning greeted us with a good morning and smile which sets your day off to a great start We thoroughly enjoyed are stay and will be back in the future ,0,164,1
 Fantastic boutique hotel in the middle of the buzzing Navigli suburb From the Moment we checked it we felt at home rooms are a great size facing the court yard with all amenities you need for a few days in Milan Nice courtyard lounge area to enjoy a glass of wine or two A very personal hotel with great staff Good spot to walk around and explore Milan for all those who do not mind walking more than 15 min to see the cathedral Dinner at the Bugande restaurant is definitely a must we ate there twice during our 4 day stay Food is fantastic and waiting staff also Carlo was especially attentive and has a great eye for detail Navigli is quite loud with a lot of restaurants and bars really great for the evenings But you hear absolutely nothing while in the rooms or hotel itself It is Very quiet Overall a fantastic little find we will definitely be back ,0,164,1
 The perfect stay Room was beautiful quiet calm and plush super comfy bed pillows Big shower with jet head and rainfall lots of closet space AC silent and quick to take effect Rooftop pool and bar was amazing perfect design great to see use of solar panels too Full gym also I did not and use on this trip however Lastly from the welcome inside with a cold drink and a full consult on the area and the to dos the smile served with each Sangria and the helping hands and warm send off to get us on our way again the staff here are an incredible asset to what is already a fabulous hotel Would always stay again and recommend this to anyone of any age and any travel type Hot tip BEST tapas and service in town are at Catalana around the corner it s busy but you never wait too long and worth it We ate there each day ,0,164,1
 1 The location is very good Close to metro lines and trams to tourist attractions It is also close to the boat station to Bratislava in Slovakia for a nice side trip 2 The hotel lobby cafe and restaurant just provide a great atmosphere of the old world The decoration antique collections and staff uniform all exceed our expectations for a hotel of this price range 3 The hotel staff are very nice and helpful 4 We booked a double bed room The hotel had some problems with the availability of the room and they generously upgraded our room to a suite free of charge We greatly appreciate it 5 The hotel laundry price is beyond our budget it may be OK for business travelers However with the convenient location we can still go to a self served laundry at Favoritenstra e 36 Greenandclean laundry The laundry is near the main train station However the metro line U1 can go there easily ,0,164,1
 The hotel is in a great location only a few minutes walk from cole Militaire Metro and a short distance to the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides There is a supermarket next door to the hotel which was great for buying water etc Despite its location the hotel was peaceful and quiet The hotel is also in a good location for restaurants make you way to Rue Cler for a really enjoyable evening The hotel itself is pleasant We had two Executive Double Rooms which were an adequate size one room was smaller than the other but had a very large bathroom The rooms were clean and comfortable Breakfast was lovely Everything was fresh and there was a good selection All the staff from the front desk to the cleaners were a credit to the hotel very pleasant and helpful Overall we had a really lovely stay and I wouldn t hesitate in recommending this hotel or staying at it again ,0,163,1
 Frankly apart from the location bank next to Buckingham palace this property is far away from what a Taj Hotel is The upholstery carpets are too old torn at places the rooms are awfully small Since it s a 1500 hospital turned to a hotel it is not an ideal hotel but to make matters worse the restaurant menu needs a lot to look into The breakfast was truly pathetic and minimal like in a typical bread and breakfast hotel Spinach paratha everyday no curries only scrambled eggs and sour to too salty sausages We had a word with the restaurant management but still nothing really changed No idles no dosage nothing And to top it the staffwas too busy with pm visit Moreover due to protests outside we were even not allowed inside by the police until someone from the staff ritesh intervened Overall will not stay here again but for its great location Hope Mr rakesh sarna reads this ,0,163,1
 Ricardo was a gem cleaning staff friendly and thorough Location was not too far to Placa Cataluna If you dont like walking a metro is a 2 minute walk from the hotel and after 2 3 metro stops you are there Once there check out the Hop on Hop Off Bus tours I always do it the first day or two I arrive in a city That way you see everything and the following day one can revisit points of interest for a longer time Hotel water pressure strong and quick to respond to hot and cold temperature The shower cubicle is made of glass which isnt frosted so if you are shy being in your birthday suit when someone else is in the room you may want to pass on this one It is a hetero friendly hotel which caters to mainly adults of various ages The guests at the hotel are liberal open minded tolerant and respectful of others ,0,163,1
 Check in was smooth staff were polite and it was a speedy process We had a twin room and it is a lot smaller than the images portray but this wasn t a major problem we settled in easily and the views from the room were nice and calm Although overpriced the breakfast buffet was lovely there was a nice variety We figured it worked out cheaper and better than getting a taxi to a get breakfast as the hotel is isolated from everything not in central amsterdam The pool is small and the changing areas are awful no privacy no lockers and one tiny shower There unfortunately were children s swimming lessons going on during our stay so several of us including children boys and girls were cramped into the whole spa area The hotel should keep such events separate from when hotel guests can use the spa facilities Overall the stay was pleasant and the hotel served its purpose ,0,163,1
 The hotel is located in a central convenient location to 2 Metro Stops Oberkampff 3mins walk around the corner from Hotel and Republique 5mins walk from Hotel and larger Metro stop with more interchange lines The highlight of this hotel is the great bed which was the most comfortable I ve ever slept in during my travel and gave good rest after a long day touring I must also mention the Team of Arnaud Gilles and Jonathan who looked after us during our stay with the most helpful friendly service They also recommended wonderful local restaurants for Dinner which we were not disappointed with I had requested a High Floor with Juliette Balcony for our Wedding Anniversary and this was provided to us on our check in Highly recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting Paris as the location is the best in my opinion with restaurants cafes boulangeries and a laundromat small supermarket just around the corner from the Hotel ,0,162,1
 Loved it here Great location for wandering around Shoreditch and all it offers The modern pod like rooms are bigger than we expected and having an Ipad to control everything in the room including allowing Netflix streaming etc was a real bonus We had great fun with the mood settings in the room It s a sociable hotel with the lounge dining area having loads of quirky space to sit and relax We actually spent more time in the hotel than we expected as we really enjoyed the atmosphere in here The drinks at the bar were reasonably priced too What really makes this a good hotel is the staff We thought with electronic check in etc that there wouldn t be many staff We were wrong They re still there helping you check in advising places to go ringing you a cab etc And they were all happy relaxed fun and helpful just like the vibe of this hotel ,0,162,1
 I tend to stay at ClubQuarters regularly on business trips and I have to assure you of the high quality at all their establishments In particular I find Lincoln s Inn Fields as well as the St Paul s to be the very best At Lincoln s Inn the graciousness and professionalism of ALL the staff especially at reception is very impressive Usually in a hotel there are one or two people who make a special effort but at Club Quarters it seems everyone makes a special effort All the Team are on the same page and this is so excellent I was made to feel relaxed at all times and everything was done with precision grace and kindness Now this is the sign of a well managed Team Whomsoever is Managing these two establishments should be very proud indeed of all their staff the hotels and facilities I cannot find fault and I have stayed in many hotels Impressive ,0,162,1
 We booked this room as an emergency we were returning from a cruise and I made a mistake about the day we were to arrive from the minute we stepped in the hotel the staff was 100 smiles and welcoming we were upgraded to balcony suite and given complimentary water and chocolates we took a long bath in there very spacious tub now were American so we take a bit more room than the average European the entire place smelled amazing the a c was crispy cold a welcomed accommodation especially in the summer time check out was a breeze and the staff at this time was also super amazing I felt safe I felt at home and I wanted to stay for the remainder of my trip I would have done so if it was possible to cancel my other reservations I hope the staff knows how amazing they are they truly were a highlight on this trip thank you,0,162,1
 The room was gorgeous very generous size with all the amenities The double bed was extremely comfy and the hotel had also give us a room with a really good view as requested which was lovely The hotel staff were extremely friendly welcoming and helpful advising us on the best places to eat and drink and also providing us with discounted tram fares and tourist excursions Although the hotel is outside of the city centre it is situation right next to one of the main tram lines that take you into the centre and are easy to navigate to and from The hotel also provided us with directions on how to get to certain places I e Dam Square and what trams to change I would highly recommend staying at this hotel although the restaurant is a little pricey the bar provideds snacks and nibbles which delicious I would and will probably be coming back to the Golden Tulip again ,0,162,1
 Only stayed one night before heading to the airport the next morning But we were very happy with the accommodations Location was great for restaurants and seeing the sigts in Milan Very comfortable beds plush towels quiet room and great wifi Since we were traveling with our two children we really appreciated the ability to book two connecting rooms and the option to choose single beds in one room There were six of us in total and we also appreciated that the hotel arranged for a minivan to take us to the airport For the 6 of us it was 120 euros which seemed like a bargain over taking two cabs which would have cost 100 euro a piece Had we known better it may have been a smarter option for us to stay the one night near the airport but this allowed us to see a few sights and probably find better restaurants for our last night in Europe ,0,162,1
 Really interesting building the room we stayed in had a mezzanine floor and would have originally formed part of the old town hall The whole hotel was decorated to a high standard The reception staff were really friendly and helped us with directions to our concert venue as the DLR was part closed Our bed was really comfortable and we had a lovely chat over breakfast with one of the owners I assumed he s a nice guy and told us loads about the building and area Breakfast was lovely and they could do more for us The horrible events of the 3rd shocked ourselves other guests and the staff and we did discuss this over breakfast which was much needed Our thoughts are with those who were affected I d like to say thank you to all members of staff who we had the pleasure of meeting and we wish you all well We look forward to returning ,0,161,1
 We was greeted by lovely friendly staff who made us feel at home right away They carried our suitcases to our room and right asked us if we had any plans organised for new years eve as reservations we re running low in all restaurants and wanted to make sure we got the most out of our stay Whilst we went out one day they spent the afternoon recommending and calling restaurants for us trying to get us a table for the night Tanya was absolutely brilliant and the restaurant we ended up going to was amazing The rooms are small and cosy but absolutely spotless and stylish The hotel is located brilliantly in Paris with only a short walkaway from the metro We are already thinking about coming back to this hotel in the summer as we loved our 3 days in Paris Thank you to all the staff for making our new years eve the best ever ,0,161,1
 We loved our superlative treatment by the staff at the Park Grand The location was excellent as well on a quiet street with a very short walk to the Tube We never opened a front door during our stay since their gentlement were so quick to open the door for us The wifi in the rooms was excellent which was important to us and we were pleasantly surprised to find several outlets to charge our various devices that were both European and North American The rooms were very clean and were just like they are pictured The location was excellent since we were near Earl s Court Station which had a Tardis as well as Starbucks a couple of pubs and good indian food all close by Ruxi recommended an excellent rooftop patio for a drink as well that we loved We hope to come back soon since this combination of great staff location and price suited us perfectly ,0,161,1
 Fantastic customer service from Paulo and Winston on the front desk Catered to my needs and were brilliant Staff were very pleasant and I will be 100 recommending this hotel to friends and family I spoke to Paulo before my stay to see if I could check out later and he helped me Winston checked me in upon arrival and he upgraded my room for me also Very friendly and nothing was too much bother The two members at the hotel who personally dealt with me were great and as a regularly visitor to hotels around the UK this has to be the best hospitality I have ever received A big thank you to Paulo and Winston and also the all the staff at Cumberland Management have done a great job at co ordinating the different departments to ensure the customer experience is of a high level and they clearly have invested in some great training for their recruits ,0,161,1
 Very nice modern hotel quite glamorous It s somewhere you could see James Bond staying Beside that I actually don t think I ve ever had better service at a hotel which is number one for me and my family We had our 15 month old boy with us and when we entered our suite we were pleasantly surprised to see a cot already set up with a cuddly toy within it The complimentary tea juice fruit and baked goods was a nice touch as well available all day and evening The staff here were absolutely incredible can t say it enough We ordered room service and they ran out of ice cream one of the staff actually went to the shops to get ice cream even though I told him there was no need Above and beyond To top the experience off the location is perfect with everything at your doorstep You certainly will enjoy your stay here ,0,161,1
 Avant Garde I loved every single thing about this hotel We stayed there for only one night but it would take me a whole page to describe it The best lounging spaces ever Fatboys laying on the grass at night to hang out with your drink two amazing terraces classy restaurant a super modern bar with rocking chairs and design couches The bed was oh so comfortable and the buffet breakfast was unforgetable and this is difficult because I try to go gluten free which is usually a nightmare in Italy What really worked perfectly for us was the location Just across the street from the train station Milano Centrale you arrive with the train and don t even need a taxi Them from there you take the subway to go to the Cathedral and all the shopping mecca s in Milan and also from the same station you catch the train to the airport no taxis no hustle ,0,161,1
 The room was large compared to European hotels in this price range and clean The staff was very friendly helpful and spoke excellent English The location is hard to beat There s a tram stop literally right out of the front door The line it s on places you about equidistant between the Museum district and the Central Station Plus if you drive to Amsterdam as we did there s a parking garage a little over a block away It s a bit pricey 48 day but if you re just there for a few days it s a secure parking spot And one of the best points of this location there s a great little bakery right across the street The sausage rolls were our daily breakfast In fact even if you don t choose this hotel make a trip to the bakery As for us we d likely stay here again on our next trip to Amsterdam ,0,161,1
 Great location in the centre of Amsterdam with most of main sights only a walk or short tram ride away The hotel is small but beautiful it is located right on a canal and each of the rooms are beautifully decorated The staff were also super friendly and very accommodating I stayed with my mom and were upgraded to a deluxe room which had a nice sitting area The rooms and lobby were just like the photos There is a great attention to detail with access to juice water coffee and tea with some biscuits in the charming lobby 24 7 There is wifi throughout and the reception also provides you with an ipad for your personal use during your stay The ipad is also loaded with lots of helpful information and good restaurant recommendations Hotel is immaculately cleaned daily and the luxury cosmetics from L occitance are a nice touch Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again ,0,161,1
 I actually live round the corner from this hotel and booked it as a birthday surprise for my sister and her fiance as a romantic break and a great way for us to catch up easily the following day Not only did i book it at a greatly discounted price but they were so lovely to upgrade the couple to the beautiful Lilly Langtry suite my sister adores 4 poster beds and the only way to describe the suite is as magnificent and they also provided complimentary wine chocolates and a fruit basket They let me know the next day that the bar staff were also truly phenomenal friendly service as well as front of house with opulent decor and great drink prices I book and stay in a lot of hotels as an event planner and most definitely will be recommending this one to everyone and making sure that i get to stay myself one day soon ,0,160,1
 Me and my wife stayed in Hilton Paris Opera Hotel in October as part of our honeymoon trip and was amazing We stay 7 nights at the Hotel and just loved the stay The staff was always so nice and helpful doing everything to make sure we could have the best stay with all the comfort The Hotel is very well located 10 minutes walking until reach the Opera Garnier and you have all kinds of transportation nearby The room was so nice and clean quietly and with an amazing outside street view We also loved the fantastic breakfast pancakes eggs and bacon yogurt and French products as well Thank you so much for all the treats you gave us The Guest Relations Capucine was also amazing helpful and concerned in make our stay the most comfortable as possible We highly recommend Hilton Paris Opera Hotel if you are going to stay in Paris We surely will return ,0,160,1
 I am writing to express my appreciation for outstanding service and professionalism by the staff at the Best Western Premier LOUVRE Saint Honore My wife and I spent five days at the hotel from October 14 18 2015 and were so pleased we returned for three days from October 25 27 2015 Based on my experience at the Louvre Saint Honore I would eagerly recommend this hotel to everyone on the basis of comfort cleanliness and excellent customer service We knew that this hotel was not a huge luxury hotel but everything from the breakfast service to the warmth and care from the staff who work at the front reservation desk was first class Everyone went the extra mile to provide a warm and welcoming environment after long and weary travel I appreciate the efforts of the daytime and evening staff and in particular Alice who stands out as an exemplary member of the Best Western international team ,0,160,1
 Great location for parks shopping and galleries Excellent room a good size and very quiet Breakfast was wonderful The choice was just right It was not an overwhelming buffet but just enough and the quality of the food was very good while the dining room is just a joy to sit in The bar was pleasant and the staff attentive and polite We even got to taste two or three wines before making our choice A highlight of our visit was the bag of frozen peas which we needed in order to cook a pea velout for a Christmas lunch This was greeted with a Well I ve never had a request like that before but a sous chef arrived within two minutes and handed over a bag of peas with a smile We are eternally grateful The pea velout was Ritz standard And the Christmas decorations were so fantastic that we just had to take some photos ,0,160,1
 Apart from the price you cannot fault this hotel for anything But saying that their clientele are the type that would afford such a price The staff were amazing and really did try go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable We had one of the Eiffel tower view rooms and words cannot describe how great this room was the view over the field across the road and then through to the tower on the right is exceptional The amenities were great and they offered loads of free movies and tv to watch the breakfast were excellent and offered something for all tastes I really do enjoy a breakfast buffet that also has a chef to cook you a nice fresh omelette And location just steps from the Eiffel tower Another plus was the wifi was the best we had on our whole trip around Europe Thank You Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower for a great stay ,0,160,1
 The bathroom wasn t clean There were hairs from either previous guests or house keepers Bed also had a few other hairs I think the hotel is dated in many parts and the windows are so old fashioned They could do with being replaced The food we ordered to the room on the first night was cold and It worth the money we paid The breakfast on the Sunday morning that we had in the room was very good In the Saturday morning there were so many people queuing that we didn t eat in the hotel The girl who was at reception when we checked in was really rude no smiles or politeness and I couldn t understand most of what she was saying to me Her English was terrible I kept having to ask her to repeat herself which didn t help with her attitude The room service staff were amazing so friendly and so helpful ,0,160,1
 This is by far the friendliest most welcoming hotel I have ever stayed in We were welcomed at reception by a lady called Zena apologies if I m spelling that wrong and she was so genuinely warm and happy I felt relaxed straight away Housekeeping were very sweet and polite and I noticed that the vibe was generally just a lot more relaxed and happy than in most five stars For this reason alone I would choose this over other five stars I have stayed at in London Special mention to the bar manager for what I feel may just be the best White Russian in London Our room was quirky but luxurious with lovely bathroom products Everything from the snacks in the room to the elevator seems really well thought out You can t get more convenient than this location yet it is very quiet and pleasant to walk around with lots of nice shops and restaurants ,0,160,1
 We arrived early morning around 10 30am Greeted right from the taxi door by the lovely doorman who kindly took our bags into the reception We were offered a complimentary glass of Cava each which we enjoyed in lobby before we headed out as our rooms weren t ready yet as explained in the check in check out times Well all I can is WOW We booked a Superior Room and can t put into words how impressed we were honestly So clean so quirky so perfect D Amaaazing large beds and the best part were the pillows Never felt anything comfier and just to add there were 12 haha I could go on and on the food was lovely the drinks were fabulous roof terrace is beautiful room service was great rooms were cleaned daily staff were great and really helpful location is brill All in all I would completely recommend Claris We will be going back 3,0,160,1
 I came to Barcelona for my 30th birthday The W hotel did not dissapoint the food was amazing the massage I had was amazing the room we had had a view overlooking the ocean Staff were all really friendly The only critised I have is when we arrived a guy took out cases and gave us a ticket we asked there members of staff if we needed to do anything with this ticket to get our cases and they all said no We then proceeded to wait nearly two hours for our cases I rang down to reception twice they said the begs would be 5 minutes I eventually had to go down and speak to The manager who told us we needed the ticket to get our bags But he have us complimentary drinks whilst we aired for them to be delivers to our room Other than that the stay was sensational I will definitely be returning ,0,160,1
 My stay in BARCELONA exceeded all of my expectations from start to finish The Hotel was excellent especially as it was so centrally located and wonderfully designed Almost everywhere could be reached on foot The Hotel Staff were extremely obliging as nothing was too much trouble for them and they provided lots of information regarding the places of interest in the City I would certainly recommend using the City Tour Buses as they provide good value for money The one ticket can be used on both routes being east and west therefore taking in many many sights that could not be reached on foot As a tip to Tourists use the blue Autobus service to and from the Airport and buy a return ticket as it is just over 10 euros per person and the travelling time is only 20 minutes approximately Why waste money on taxis when you could be spending it on all that wonderful cuisine ,0,160,1
 This 3 day trip was to celebrate my daughter s 18th birthday I cannot begin to tell you how impressed we were with the hotel and staff Nothing was too much trouble From the lovely surprise when the reception team advised they had upgraded our rooms to the birthday cake let alone the cava and beautiful fruit chocolate which the hotel staff so kindly gave us to celebrate my daughter s birthday everything was fantastic The hotel is spotless the location is great however it was the staff who made the difference even their recommendations for dinner restaurants were outstanding We will undoubtedly be staying at Olivia Plaza again on our next visit to Barcelona and I have already recommended this to colleagues family and friends I was so impressed with the professional friendly and caring way the staff treated us in particular my daughter which made her birthday celebrations even more special The customer service was outstanding ,0,160,1
 The proximity to the Gloucester Road tube station was excellent We used the Gatwick express to get from the airport to Victoria station From the hotel we walked to Harrods and then to Kensington High street in the other direction There were lots of attractions restaurants bars within walking distance too Even though the hotel was fully booked it was so quiet there were a few other people in the bar when we arrived back at teatime for our free prosecco but we really didn t see anyone until breakfast Continental breakfast was really fresh with a great variety and good coffee You can order a hot breakfast if you want and pay a bit extra We requested a late check out and this was extended to 1 pm which was fantastic as we had to get dressed to attend the Queen s garden party I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would like to go back ,0,159,1
 Picked this hotel because of the location and it was excellent with lots of local shops and places to eat nearby in the roads away from the main road The staff were very helpful and went out of their way to ensure that we had any information we needed and advise about local amenities The hotel is decorated in a traditional style suitable to the period which is very well done I can see that other reviews have interpreted this d cor as tired but although perhaps there is some wear on the carpets in some places the hotel is very clean and the overall look is well created It s probably best not to stay here if you like white bright minimalist style The bedroom was a little small but adequate and the bed was very comfortable and we had a view of the Royal Albert Hall so very pleasant I would definitely stay here again ,0,159,1
 We enjoyed this hotel very much The location is wonderful very central 1 minute walk from the central square Plaza de Catalunya from where you can make city tours by bus The service in the hotel was very good the staff is very helpful and friendly Rooms are comfortable and clean We had one at the back of the hotel I can not judge how it is on the street side it might be noisy at times We only ate one time breakfast not included in the price in the hotel during our 3 nights stay No complaints at all It was very good But there are many places around the square and on Las Ramblas where you can eat a good and cheaper breakfast Overall we left the hotel with very positive feelings and definitely will come back to this hotel when we return to Barcelona one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited ,0,159,1
 Ayre Gran Via Hotel was close to the metro and a major shopping centre The staff were lovely and able to communicate with me as I had limited Spanish The room was all that you needed as a traveller who was out exploring the sites most of the day and if I did stay in for a bit I had a great view of the main road Ayre Gran Via Hotel was close to the metro and a major shopping centre The staff were lovely and able to communicate with me as I had limited Spanish I happened to have a delayed flight and when I called and spoke with the general reception they were incredibly helpful and accomodating The room was all that you needed as a traveller who was out exploring the sites most of the day and if I did stay in for a bit I had a great view of the main road ,0,159,1
 The view from the room was fantastic the sun deck and pool area where superb including the view chilled and relaxing aided by a cheeky cocktail from the bar Breakfast selection covered all requirements and staff where efficient and on hand at all times The rooms where spacious clean with very comfortable beds Location was over the road from the beach 10 minutes from metro station that could get you to any part of the city needed Around the hotel there was plenty of bars and resturants that where amazing And dotted around where little parks open areas to relax in Area was generally quiet no traffic even the main road the hotel is on caused no noise or issue I traveled with 4 others who all wanted something different from the holiday beach city sun soaking pool bars culture and the location as well as barcelona itself was the perfect spot to cover everyone s needs ,0,159,1
 Great breakfast very clean rooms excellent staff It s a bit difficult to find due to being in a pedestrian zone but once you know it s very easy The hotel is a bit dated compared to newer design hotels however it delivers more in terms of charm Beds are very good compared to those same newer design hotels like nhow Staff is very friendly they even have a bell boy man that brings your luggage to the room which is a nice touch The staff is also very professional calling up to the room if they can clean the room in the afternoon if you put up the do not disturb sign most hotels would just skip room cleaning until the next day Location is excellent right in the middle of the Navigli area it s right around the corner so at night you ll be right in the middle of great bars and restaurants A ,0,159,1
 I used to go clubbing at Les Bains back when it was only a club and one of the trendiest in Paris So I was super excited to explore the new design and VIP feeling of staying there The location cannot be beat if you like walking around old and trendy Paris Staff was nice and responsive The clear disappointement for me was the size of the Classic Room and the price I paid for it The room was so small that my partner and I could not get around the hallway at the same time I constantly knocked my knees when going to the toilet which was in the middle of the bathroom Also you ll need earplugs if you re staying on a weekend as the room overlooks the courtyard where people drink and music plays Just didn t feel the price was justified but it was a good once in a time experience ,0,158,1
 This is a comfortable hotel very close to Gloucester Road tube station and consequently well connected to the Piccadilly and circle lines We went to different theatres concert halls and museums with no hassle at all There are good restaurants locally and in central London if you choose not to eat at the hotel The hotel is also an easy walk to the river and in the opposite direction to Holland Park Museums are either close by walking or by tube The breakfast room is large but the buffet works well There is a small shop restaurant and Starbucks on the ground floor There is a business lounge that we had access to and this made a nice place for a break and a snack supplied by the hotel The atmosphere at the hotel is very good and the staff are very helpful One can leave bags in a secure area on the day of departure ,0,158,1
 Location was great It s in the gothic quarter old town area 5 mins walk to the port and bottom part of Las Ramblas Lots of quaint tapas restaurants close by and cafes for coffees and pastries Small and clean hotel Very friendly staff We stayed in the suite 501 Modern small room with large bathroom and walk In shower The best part about it was our private roof top terrace with hot tub However the hot tub isn t hot it s warm We used it on the first night but that was it Wasn t very clean either For the price we paid I didn t think it was good value for money The views were lovely thou and we enjoyed sitting outside of an evening Barcelona is a lovely city We honestly didn t spend that much time in the room until the evening Fab tapas restaurant close by called Sensi highly recommend ,0,158,1
 This hotel is absolutely beautiful Me and my boyfriend spent 4 nights at the Jaz hotel and were extremely impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff The interior blew us away The decor both in the room and throughout the breakfast and dining area was stunning The food at breakfast was typical European breakfast accompanied by fresh juice all of which was very delicious The staff on reception were very welcoming both on arrival and whenever we returned to the hotel after being in the city Also the cleaning staff and staff at breakfast were also very friendly and cheery every morning The hotel is about a 20 minute ride on the metro from the city centre With the trains being so frequent this wasn t an issue and was in fact better in my opinion You could leave the bustle of the city and return to a beautiful room to relax and recover ,0,158,1
 Very comfortable beds clean room and bathroom very quiet location Room is cleaned everyday and you get fresh towels whenever needed Showergel and shampoo are free in the bathroom The only thing you must consider is that the hotel is located outside town in the middle of a green area the only shop in the area is a gas station close to the hotel but it was enough for our needs they have lots of snacks drinks and other items you might need As I said far away fom the city center but definitely not a problem if you don t need to go back to the hotel several times during the day From the airport the free shuttle takes you to the hotel in less than 10 minutes And to reach the city center there s a bus stop for line 197 which takes you to the museum area in no more than 15 minutes ,0,158,1
 Myself and my partner traveled as a couple for a romantic break at the end of January and what can I say Our exceptions where definitely surpassed Extreme elegance with a modern twist Exceptional attention to small details from the hotel scent the candlelight reception to the surfacing on the elevators made every aspect of this small hotel endearing and charming The staff were very welcoming accommodating and friendly They even provided is with an iPad and phone chargers for some work we had to do The balcony in our room overlooked the Placa Sant Felip Neri and each evening we had the pleasure of hearing local acoustic musicians playing through our balcony doors The roof top terrace was also a favourite of ours With a perfect location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter we would recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to Barcelona We are already planning our next visit ,0,158,1
 The hotel was big and new Check in process was quite slow The hotel s front is currently under construction and not mentioned There was quite a bit of noise in the morning Also due to the construction work if you have a car you need to drive it out of the hotel and all the way around the block to get to the car park at the back of the hotel Abit of an issue The hotel is generally over packed with tourist buses meaning breakfast is jam packed in the morning with the tourist from the buses going crazy over breakfast Staff in the breakfast room was great They attended to requests such as coffee Location wise the hotel is quite far out from the city centre There is a train station close by but abit of a walk and not too appealing at night with the surrounding The neighborhood isn t the best ,0,158,1
 We had a wonderful stay and loved our time at Hotel De Banville We thoroughly recommend staying here as it was close to the metro and in a quiet and clean neighbourhood The staff were magnificent particularly the beautiful young lady on the front desk who was so helpful polite and accomodating We stayed in Marie a top floor suite with glorious views of the Eiffel Tower even from the bath Breakfasts are very tasty with lots on offer Tuesday evenings are a pleasant surprise with the owner entertaining guests staying here with her own singing Unfortunately she was away in the time we stayed but I m told she puts on food and drinks for the guests while she performs Very kindly we were given a copy of her CD to keep as we missed the performance Im enjoying remembering our stay while I listen to it and look forward to staying here again ,0,157,1
 I payed for late check out at 8 in the morning I was woken up by men knocking on the door to check the boiler I refused them to come in as there was 4 girls and we did not feel commutable Then we were woken again by builders on our roof and in our yard looking through our window smoking at our door and dropping things off the roof I had to leave early as it was scary uncomfortable I asked them to move also reported at reception and still waiting on a call back now nearly a week later Before leaving on two more occasions they knocked on the door to come in the bedroom and check the boiler Disappointed after a lovely stay I have videos of this 8 in the morning but it will not allow me to upload but I would like everyone to see what we woke up to ,0,157,1
 The service was excellent We received advice from the reception in regards to the room and other hotel amenities In the room we had 2 free bottles of water along with tea and coffee The presentation booklet was tailored for our stay with recommendations for restaurants and places to visit The room was very clean and also the cleaning service was doing a good job We didn t try the room service but they seem to have various options The breakfast was very good with plenty of option to choose from We left very early in the morning and the staff was so nice they arranged for a taxi to come pick us up fixed price not matter of the traffic way he was going and served us with coffee water and some pastry for which he didn t want to charge us Very good experience would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris ,0,157,1
 OMG we love this hotel I think it s the 2nd best hotel we ve stayed during our 3 weeks around Europe This is a 4 stars hotel BUT deserve the 5 stars rating The room we ve got was amazingly unique an attic room top floor so unusual so cozy with a view of the canal itself I traveled w my Mom sister and she has her own small room separate from our bed area The reception staff will help you to find a perfect tour packages for you And they are very helpful friendly too Outside the hotel is a beautiful street a typical street in Amsterdam Very safe and it s not at a crowded dodgy area Lots of quaint small restaurants shops Tips use Uber if you need to go anywhere if you don t want to walk LOVE THIS HOTEL Will definitely come back if we go to Amsterdam again ,0,157,1
 The Hotel was very clean and affordable The room was really wonderful with plenty of light and room enough to move around Closet space was more than adequate The bathroom was roomy but no shelf space to out your lotion or cosmetic This was a very nice last minute find as I had to leave another hotel which was subpar and the same price An up to date lobby which was welcoming The staff were so accommodating and friendly Breakfast was not including in the price but I could have done that Breakfast was plentiful and had variety of breakfast items to choose from My room was quiet even though it was on the front of the building facing the street Transportation tram right outside the front door took me to center city in less than 15 minutes Wonderful location in the city but not in the heart of all the noise and tourist bussle ,0,157,1
 I couldn t fault a single thing My boyfriend and I arrived in Amsterdam on Friday and the staff couldn t have been more welcoming or helpful The hotel was immaculate loved the quirky interior design We were very impressed with the room as it was a perfect size for a couple and loved that you could control everything from the mood lighting to the blinds and television through the IPad Location is brilliant tram stop number 5 was right outside our hotel which allows you to go all the way to centraal station and Zuid Station was a 5 minute walk at the very most The worst part was having to check out not because it was stressful it was the easiest procedure of checking in and out that i have ever experienced but because we had to leave Thank you for having us CitizenM we will definitely be back in the near future ,0,157,1
 This is my favorite hotel I have stayed here three times and never been disappointed It is located right next to the Louvre and the Tuileries Gardens near a stop on metro line 1 and within easy walking distance of the Paris Opera and the Musee d Orsay The hotel is in an original Haussmann building with decorations in Art Nouveau style An old world Parisian style pervades the building and the excellent service but a recent remodeling has made the rooms and the bathrooms state of the art Many of the rooms have Eiffel Tower views we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Eiffel Tower suite with a table on a small balcony where we could have breakfast overlooking the Eiffel Tower the Louvre and many of the top Paris monuments Hotels in Paris can be expensive and this one is but we left with a feeling of money well spent ,0,156,1
 After a very warm welcome we were shown to our suite room This was most tastefully decorated without any naff art on the walls and thankfully without the unnecessary range of useless extra small cushions propped up against the two main night pillows The bathroom was a good surprise being as spacious as the bedroom itself with Villeroy and Boch fittings The bed was extremely comfortable with good quality pillows At all times the staff were most courteous and helpful and we spoke several times with a delightful Romanian doorman who originally showed us to our room Most conveniently positioned near to the Barbican and Liverpool Street stations in a most interesting building Because we were eating out with a previous family arrangement for a special birthday celebration we didn t experience the food on this first occasion All together this was a most comfortable and enjoyable experience Highly recommended T C E from Suffolk,0,156,1
 Hotel was in an excellent location staff very helpful and friendly It was my partners birthday and we wanted to book a nice meal so I discussed with one of the guys on reception who checked us in and very friendly sorry can t remember his name he help us pick a place and the next day when we arrived back at the hotel after a day of shopping and sightseeing in the room was some fruit and a bottle of Prosecco with a lovely note wishing him happy birthday Would definitely stay at this hotel again The view from the sky bar was fabulous and even though the bar staff had a private function they still allowed to have a quite drink in the corner We are very well traveled and stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and this was not a disappointment and would recommend it to anyone ,0,156,1
 We stayed at Batty Langley on our wedding night and it was such an amazing experience An absolute gem of a place right in the heart of London We were upgraded on arrival to the suite and offered free champagne as a welcome it was such a lovely touch by the staff and really appreciated The hotel is like stepping back in time and a world away from outside which makes for the perfect tonic to city life for recharging the batteries and jumping back into the mix We would like to say a big thank you to the staff for being so considerate and kind and for making our wedding day even more special We would love to go back and if you are looking for a place to stay that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed without the gimmick that other high end hotels in the city provide look no further ,0,155,1
 This hotel was about a 10 minute drive from Westfield shopping centre There is plenty of parking on the premises Check in was quick and easy staff were very friendly and welcoming We were given warm cookies on arrival which was a lovely touch The room was a good size and clean Breakfast was good cereal pastries full English and option of Omlette There were also pancakes which were very nice and another lovely touch On check out we mentioned to the receptionist Sonia that the heater in the room was quite loud and disturbed our sleep and straight away Sonia eliminated the parking fee and offered us a complimentary coffee from Starbucks This was a very nice gesture and although we had a problem with the room I can see that the staff go out of their way to compensate and make our stay worth while I would definitely stay here again ,0,155,1
 Great location for The Louvre Notre Dame Palais Du Luxembourg and Musee D Orsay as all within a reasonably short walk The area has plenty of cafes bars and restaurants close by All staff were very friendly and the rooms and public areas were spotless Our room was in the original 17th century part of the hotel but sympathetically modernised It was nice and quiet at we both got a great night s sleep This is a great base for people who want to be out and about sightseeing and experiencing Parisian life rather than being hotel bound as the hotel majors on service rather than high spec pools gyms and other leisure facilities It does have live jazz which was going strong when we got back at 10pm It was a Saturday night and every table and bar stool were taken and you can t book in advance so get there early ,0,155,1
 The hotel may not be in the best area But the hotel was great was and the staff made it even more so All very friendly and helpful If you are planning to spend time in Montmatre it is within walking distance but be warned you need to be fit Also a short walk from Gare Du Nord and on a direct metro line 12 to the museums Eiffel Tower etc There was a little mix up with our taxi on the last day but it was rectified and we arrived at the station with plenty of time to check in The breakfast was perfectly adequate Would certainly consider staying again The area may be a little rough around the edges but my friend and I enjoyed a walk around the market both at night and in the daytime and found the people very friendly and helpful with directions when we needed them ,0,155,1
 As soon as I made the reservation Casa Camper greeted me with a welcoming and informative email They arranged for transfers from the port and to the airport Francisco and Morgan greeted us as if we were long time guests The personalized tour and immediate check in made us relaxed and comfortable Every detail for a guest s comfort is there To order breakfasts 24 hour complimentary snacks actually real food and drinks wine and beer at a nominal cost newspapers clean rooms fluffy towels bottled water assistance with maps dinner reservations roof top terrace with a rain machine are just a few of the impressive items Quiet and well situated location Thank you Francisco Morgan Valentina Enzo Paolo Andre and Christina for your personable and happy service Please also thank the other staff that we did not meet but who made this trip one of the most memorable So impressed and grateful ,0,155,1

 First of all every single person in the hotel s staff was incredibly kind they really made me feel at ease during my stay plus they helped me solve a problem with my boarding pass in five seconds flat Room 810 is very very quiet comfortable and spacious enough for one person There is a huge shower box in the bathroom and a lot of useful items scattered around the room such as a hairdryer iron and ironing board usb and hdmi plugs and squeaky clean kettle and microwave oven I also appreciated the Handy device you can carry with you this way you can roam about without a thought to your own smartphone suddenly parting ways with BT Fon WiFi and google maps vanishing right when you re walking somewhere new Cleanliness is obviously paramount and the whole place smells divine from the room to the corridors to the main hall ,0,154,1

 I love French hotels there is always something funny or strange and there is always an element that challenges my improvisation skills The Waldorf Madeleine did not disappoint in that way Wanting to take a shower I accidently converted the bathroom in a pool as the design of the showerhead and how it was mounted could not lead to any other results This time my improvisation skills did not provide a solution I was baffled by this piece of French ingenuity on shower design The other challenge a window that did not close was solved by using the hotel directory in a new and different way My hunger for improvisation was satisfied Furthermore the hotel is on a great location the bed was very nice and good and the airco is powerful so on hot days you ll still be able to recreate the inside of a fridge should you like ,0,153,1

 This is my second visit to Amsterdam and likewise my second stay at the Manor Hampshire Hotel It is a stunning historic building that has been thoroughly updated inside I love it s convenience and location it is far enough away from the city center to be peaceful yet near enough to 2 main trams that get you to the city or to the museums quickly The neighborhood is considered up and coming and has plenty of stores and restaurants The room decor is quite amusing see picture of the graphic over our bed and the colorful red crosses from the Amsterdam flag are everywhere Our concierge Hans was so helpful and knowledgeable going out of his way to find a specific restaurant for my vegetarian husband I will definitely return for another visit to Amsterdam and I look forward to staying in The Manor Hampshire Hotel in the future ,0,152,1

 After managing to lose our car keys after a few too many cocktails the staff were so helpful and understanding The bar downstairs is beautifully situated on the river Thames and prices were incredible along with the views After originally booking the hotel for one night and ending up staying for two the rooms were perfect well equipped with a decent sized TV and comfortable bed which was perfect for cheese and biscuits after a little too much wine The room sizes are lovely and big so there s plenty of space for getting ready and spreading different outfits all over the place The hotel itself was beautiful and clean This hotel is now our first choice for everytime we come back to London Situated 5 minutes from the tube and 2 minutes away from a couple of quirky bars and a huge shopping mall Highly recommend ,0,149,1

 Besides being a gorgeous building in a great location the staff of this hotel were absolutely superior in every way I started getting emails the minute we made our reservation and before we left home we had restaurant reservations and lots of information for our stay From arrival to departure everyone was so helpful cheerful and accommodating We had a problem watching movies on demand and they offered us another room Goodies left for us every night The location was stellar two blocks in either direction and your were in a main area Piccadilly Circus Trafalgar Square The Mall theater district shopping We were in the center of it all The restaurant was excellent and room service was very fast We cannot say enough good things about this hotel we loved it and will stay there again for sure And try other Sofitel hotels in other countries ,0,149,1
 Shocking Overpriced and very badly cooked Everything overcooked dried out Fried eggs burnt Scrambledd eggs a hard mess No muesli Only one juice grim looking croissants Had a better fresh breakfast with full choices and fresh croissants and pastries My room was totally unsuitable for self catering II warmed up lasagne in the MW oven and despite the aircon being on full blast two days later my room still stank of food Bad Very very cramped and uncomfortable reception and office area Unsuitable for business and no confidentiality Suitcases hand lugagge and backpacks all over the place and only one 2 seater couch in the marble foyer to sit and await car collection or to meet friends I would never try to have a business meeting in my room in this hotel or invite a business guest to have a meal with me in the hotel restaurant ,0,149,1
 The staff was amazing there was nothing too much trouble for them We had an early check in We just wanted to leave our bags behind us but the men at reception offered a ready room The receptionist young spanish guy with glasses unfortunately I can t remember his name was the best so far You have to know I working in a 5 star hotel in London but I wish I had his colleauge Just so naturally kind and polite His knowledge about guest service and about the city is highlighted The room is fully equipped the location is brilliant just 5 minutes walk from the beach Just hard to say negative about the hotel yeah the lift so many times just stopped to work wich was fixed within minutes so who cares Definitely will be my choice in autumn when I return back to the city,0,149,1
 After being let down by Citadines South Kensington they were relocating my husband and I to another side of London without prior notice we took a chance on a nearby hotel Millennium Bailey s and we re glad we did I don t know why Citadines label their branch as posh as they don t even have a porter and well lit lounge unlike Bailey s The staff were very welcoming and courteous The room we were assigned in was a good size for a London location Even though the hotel is next to a Tube station and a busy road we didn t hear much of the noise from outside There are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby Moreover the Natural History Museum and the Royal Albert Hall are just walking distance All in all my husband and I had a pleasant stay Many thanks ,0,148,1

 Boutique classic in the heart of the vibrant Latin Quarter The staff were exceptional and so friendly polite and helpful Our room was well apointed and featured a beautiful little terrace overlooking Saint Severin The Pantheon and the classic roof tops of Paris Sitting on the terrace over Easter listening to the church bells ring out from Notre Dame was unforgettable The location was great close to so many wonderful sights yet it was quiet and peaceful at night There are lots of food options of all prices close by as well as parks and less touristy spots to enjoy I would highly recommend this lovely hotel we usually stay in an apartment when we have visited in the past but as we were only staying 5 days we decided on a hotel and we could not have been more pleased with our choice Loved it ,0,148,1
 Stayed at this new hotel the week it opened Friday 15th Sunday 17th January 2016 and I enjoyed my stay in this quieter part of the city The hotel was easy to find just 10 minutes away by train direct from Schiphol airport to Sloterdijk Station and the hotel could be seen from the station Check in was quick and easy hotel was spotless and everything was brand new I stayed in a triple room which was lovely with comfortable beds and a nice bathroom Hotel staff were really friendly and helped us a lot during our stay Location was great too literally 5 minutes away by train from Amsterdam central station it was nice to relax in a quieter part of the city after a busy day Free wifi was also a bonus Would recommend this hotel and would stay here again in future thankyou ,0,148,1
 Upon arrival the staff were very accommodating We got to the hotel 2 hours before check in 1pm and were very pleased to hear that they had our room ready I was initially skeptical about the panoramic views of Amsterdam but it is safe to say when we walked into our room on the 22nd floor we were blown away the view was spectacular The bedroom was spacious with everything in perfect working order I couldn t fault this hotel in any way In addition to this the bar on the top floor make fantastic cocktails Unfortunately with our speedy 1 night trip we didn t have time to make use of the spa next time I would recommend renting the bicycles you can do this from the reception and cycling up the road to Bakers and Roasters for the best brunch in Amsterdam enjoy everyone ,0,148,1
 This is a hidden gem Everything about Hotel Neri was exceptional I am very pick when it comes to hotels but there was not a single negative aspect here From the start the front desk was so nice and warming It is a little trick to get to the hotel since it is hidden behind the Cathedral in a pedestrian street but Daniel waited for us and helped us with all our bags The building is a dream impeccable in every detail The rooms so clean quiet cozy and comfortable The decoration amazing And the location Oh my God We were right in the middle of everything within seconds of walking Safe neighborhoods great places to eat including the hotel the breakfast was delicious great for shopping and within minutes of the famous places to visit Transportation available super easy We really felt sad to leave ,0,148,1
 Absolutely loved staying here from start to finish Much nicer than we originally expected mainly due to me not doing my research and just booking the cheapest hotel I could find on here turns out we had an AMAZING deal If you have time and have a chance please try their brasserie downstairs the food is absolutely to die for We were lucky enough to be able to have a Sunday brunch in the run up to Christmas so the value for money was second to none Starting with soup then a salad tapas buffet followed by a choice of mains we went for the prime rib of black angus beef expected a small portion received a big plate with a great portion of top quality food and followed by a choice of desserts All that for 25pp you simply cannot do better than that ,0,147,1
 This hotel was amazing We had a wonderful view of The Eiffel Tower the room was spacious the staff was very helpful the food in both the breakfast buffet and the restaurant were top notch I could go on and on about how amazing this On top of that the concierge emailed me the week before and made some VIP options available for my wife and me including a car service from the airport and champagne in the room upon arrival Finally the hotel is within walking distance to several public transportation outlets which made it very easy to get around the city This was our honeymoon and the staff and location of The Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel helped in making it such a special experience for us We would recommend the Pullman to anyone planning to go to Paris You won t be disappointed ,0,147,1
 This hotel is amazing We enjoyed everything about our stay The building is beautiful in a great location to catch the tram around the city and within the Hallen complex there is a cinema shops and Food Hallen a great place to eat with a really lively atmosphere Our ground floor room was great spacious with a huge comfy bed The bathroom was also beautiful bath is big enough for 2 All the staff we encountered during our stay couldn t have been more helpful or friendly lots of little added extras are available for free including good coffee and bath robes We drank at the bar great cocktails and ate in Remise47 the small intimate restaurant the food was amazing and recommendations helpful We thought the hotel was fantastic value one of the best we ve been to Thank you we will be back ,0,147,1
 Really comfortable rooms immaculately kept The staff went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible As we were on our honeymoon we had complimentary drinks a Polaroid taken for us to keep a congratulatory card in the room Taxis restaurants anything we needed was booked for us The location was walking distance to all the main attractions yet had a really local non tourist feel to it Everything was so relaxed and comfortable We felt like we were amongst friends The breakfast was amazing with carefully selected ingredients there was a choice of a different local menu each day as well as a continental breakfast and prosecco And of course tea coffee and juices In the afternoon there was free tea and cake in the salon By far the best hotel breakfast offered We will definitely be returning one day ,0,147,1
 This hotel is great value for money there is a train station right outside the door of glam hotel the service was excellent and the staff were very friendly We had breakfast at the hotel and there was a good selection of food from sausages to pancakes and tartes Dinner was also perfect the food was very tasty i do recommend going all inclusive as it can be very boring eating pizza and pasta everyday at other resturants we were kindly upgraded to a junior suite as the lady at the reception told us that the superior room we booked has a glass bathroom and gave us the option to upgrade for free which was very kind of her the room was great and so was the view very clean and tidy i really reccomend this hotel it made my stay in milan 100x better ,0,147,1
 Frankly disappointing I usually stay at Claridges and was expecting similar service levels On first day of my stay it took an hour and a half to get a simple document scanned and emailed to me and I had to ask three different people on reception to assist I was told when checking in that it may be possible to change my room which was end of corridor with a view of brick wall This didn t particularly bother me but thought it was a nice touch and shame no one followed up on it No information was given about breakfast gym opening times The newspaper I ordered on day of check out did not arrive No bespoke or particularly attentive service by any staff in the hotel Nothing particularly wrong just felt soulless and was not the 5 experience I was looking forward to ,0,147,1
 The decor of the hotel is outstanding very modern trendy perfect for a young couple having a romantic trip The 360 terrace is cool with beautiful views The food is very good general ambience of the restaurant is chilled and again very modern The rooms are gorgeous not huge but really nice additional touches see through shower electronic sliding blinds full length windows fluorescent lighting that you change colour over the bed coffee machine iPod dock flatscreen TV and a massive sized bed Don t worry about other reviews about the area yes honestly it s not the nicest part of Barcelona but you are 5 minutes walk from Ramblas if that Like all cities all over the world stay on the main streets you won t encounter any undesirables Overall we loved it Would absolutely stay here again and massively recommend for young couples ,0,147,1
 The bed were terribly uncomfortable we changed our room from Superior to Junior Suite in a hope we will get a more comfortable bed but the bed was the same cheap quality we could not get good night sleep You can t unpack in the superior room the closet is 41 cm 16 5 inches narrow I guess the people who designed and who approved that design are used to throwing their stuff on the floor and keeping it there The design of the superior room looks like the designer just got out of the kindergarten in love with primary colors We stayed in the hotel last year and loved it that s why we came back but it turned out that back in January the hotel underwent a renovation It was obviously done on a cheap and the main casualty was the bed comfort ,0,147,1
 The locality of the hotel is absolutely perfect for exploring Vienna Everything is within walking distance and there s some lovely cafes close by The hotel itself is exactly what you d expect for the money you pay The rooms are quite small however wonderfully decorated well equipped comfortable and very clean Just what you need for a few days away The walls are a little thin and you can hear conversations from those next to you but it was bearable Very reasonably priced in my opinion We asked for assistance from the hotel staff on two occasions and they were so helpful They really went above and beyond what I was expecting The receptionists helped us with booking an excursion to the Opera and with directing us to the airport bus stop Overall our stay was great and I d definitely recommend this hotel ,0,147,1
 The man at the front desk was extremely friendly and very helpful The room was small but cozy and clean There was a thermostat in the room which I REALLY appreciated given how cold London can be The shower had amazing pressure and the lotions body wash smelled great The breakfast in the morning was ok but given how expensive London is I appreciated having that as an option There is also a bar in the lobby so I was able to take a glass of champagne back to my room The neighborhood was very closely located to the tube and bus station but the vibe of the neighborhood was a bit weird grungy I was able to take the bus to another part of town for dinner which was an easy commute given its only a 6 minute walk to the tube bus ,0,146,1
 Staff were absolutely incredible Not one bad word to say every single one of them went above and beyond for each one of us and made us feel very welcome and comfortable We were a group of 3 girls 20 22 years old we weren t 100 sure about the location after reading some of the reviews but we did not have any issues Local restaurants were thriving over the weekend Aldgate East tube station across the road 5 mins from Shoreditch which is a great night out A easy commute into central 20 mins at the most direct tubes to and from Victoria coach station which was great for us Brick lane 5 minute walk up the road actually on the same street definitely worth a visit on a sunday The hotel was comfortable clean and very relaxing Highly recommended for any occasion ,0,146,1
 Rooms The beds were comfortable the bathrooms were a decent size comfortable to move around and the shower had good temperature and flow control Breakfast We did not avail breakfast while booking the rooms primarily because we felt eating the same breakfast for six days would be tiresome So we had breakfast every alternate day It was very good spread buffet style breakfast cereals bread pastries eggs grilled vegetables fried potatoes of some form sausages vegan meat fruits yoghurt cheese sliced meat condiments spreads and beverages The food tasted good Location The hotel is just a 2 minute walk from the Victoria Station the Victoria Underground and the Victoria Coach Station The bus stop for the sightseeing bus hop on hop off is also nearby 5 8 minute walk These are several restaurants cafes eateries nearby The staff were very helpful pleasant and friendly ,0,146,1
 Me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night in January for shopping in London location was good if you want a cheap stay and value for money We had to walk around 15minutes from the hotel to the underground that takes you to Oxford Circus and such BE CAREFUL IF ANYONE OUTSIDE ANY UNDERGROUND STATIONS OFFERS TO TAKE YOU TO THE HOTEL OR SHOW YOU THE DIRECTION TO ANYWHERE This happened to myself and my boyfriend outside the underground on Queensway and once we realised the man was trying to take us in the complete opposite direction to where google maps was showing us and refused to go with him he ran away Overall though such a lovely stay lovely breakfast lovely swimming pool we had it all to ourselves Very helpful and lovely staff definitely reccomemed for a posh but affordable getaway ,0,146,1
 Stayed for 10 nights from the 26th of november really reccomend this hotel for top quality cleanliness and service in a quiet area yet close to everything you need The highlight of my stay was walking in the hotel door being greeted by a great man Mr Cornellio always happy hard working and offering assistance to me even on my rough days seeing him really cheered me up The hotel is a 2 minute walk from earls court station and various fast food places making it perfect as a base for exploring london If you enjoy walking i found my 15 minute walk to harrods pleasant and was even able to stop by the natural history museum on my way I would reccomend the full english breakfast for those trying to get a good meal in for the day ahead it was reasonably priced ,0,146,1
 We genuinely loved everything Firstly the Spanish girl on reception who checked us in was wonderful and welcoming we discussed some places I had travelled in Spain and the foods and then the fresh home made Sangria that was on the reception desk and our love of Spain s culture and scenery I explained it was my birthday and we needed a late checkout and after a brief discussion with her colleague we were blissfully granted an upgrade to a more spacious room as a treat from the hotel Wonderful The room was very smart and the shower was amazing but what we loved most was the original art that decorated all the corridors if we had more time we would have viewed them all as the hotel could humbly compete with many an art gallery Of course the hotel was also beautiful throughout ,0,146,1
 The hotel was right next to the metro station Clot line L1 which has connection to line L9sud from El prat airport Terminal 1 The breakfast was rich it had everything that anyone cold ask for The room was very clean and the size of it was actually big I stayed with my husband and my 3 year old baby girl who slept in a baby cot and the room that gave us had a small balcony with a really nice view The staff was really friendly The bed and the pillows were soft and very comfortable I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would choose it again if I ever visit Barcelona again There is also a space in the lobby which is equipped with kids toys Very friendly and safe neighborhood for kids right next to the hotel there is playground ,0,146,1
 Staff was very helpful from the start gave us an upgraded room very spacious Inside everything was very clean and beautifully arranged The room looked out at the garden but there was no view since the window was on the ground But it was not a problem We loved it Bathroom was just like on the pictures gorgeous Pillows make all the difference for me in the hotel and here they were just perfect not too soft but i was sinking in them Had a Great sleep especially because we were traveling further the next day this was just what I needed I would recommend this hotel to everyone Great location walking distance to major attractions stores and feels very safe around Their rooftop bar and a restaurant is a must to visit too regardless where you stay It has great views and service ,0,146,1
 The staff was very friendly and helpful The location is great I did not want to stay in the central part of town so this was perfect for me Only few minutes away from Leidseplein where we took the tram and we would be in the central in 10 minutes We had breakfast once at the hotel and it was almost 20 euros It is good value if you eat alot but I thought it was too much for couple of croissant and a cup of coffee We had fresh sheets and towels daily except for the second last day which was annoying we had a small double room and although its small it is actually really good size with a nice bathroom and a tv I recommend this hotel to everyone and I really loved the location and how nice the hotel looked ,0,146,1
 Reception staff very friendly They are speaking a lot of languages when we came we spoke some Polish Russian English with reception workers Room very beautiful gorgeously decorated with amazing light s in the ceeling under the bed Bed very big and comfortable very big choice of the pillows we had 3 different types of pillows per person in the room A lot of usefull things free of charge soap shampoo bath salt some cosmetics Bathroom very clean and nice Unfortunately we have stayed only for one night When it comes to the breakfasts in this beautiful hotel they are very different then usuall breakfasts in hotels Very homely atmosphere and big choise of food comfortable seats and a lot of drinks I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to visit Paris with girlfriend or wife Best regards Tim Ira,0,145,1
 We were there for the London Marathon The staff had hand written notes on gift bags for all of the runners checking in that included items like running gels Epsom salt coconut water water and other snacks Check in time was pretty busy being that there are only so many computers to check people in However those that were not checking people in were going through the line offering mocktails and chocolates while chatting with the guests I also loved how they offered a breakfast early in the morning specific for those running in the marathon and they know how we runners eat breakfast when some people are going to bed from the night before They also had a table of water and bananas in the lobby the morning of the race Just a fantastic place to make us all feel so welcome ,0,145,1
 This hotel is quiet private and chic If you like the feeling of privacy in a beautiful place and a cool neighborhood this is the hotel for you This is not one of those grand hotels and so the hallways are a bit too narrow and some of the rooms are not as great as others I think this all adds to the charm of the place and the sense of history The staff was friendly and helpful Even the ladies who cleaned the rooms were sweet Don t miss out on having breakfast in the 2 beautiful rooms downstairs Really a treat This was our 2nd time there and we were upgraded to a family suite which was a wonderful surprise We were 3 and had 2 bedrooms a living room and 2 bathrooms It was for us a very memorable stay ,0,145,1

 We loved how convenient this location was because we were only in London for an overnight stay due to a layover and we were able to take the tube from the airport to the stop only 2 blocks from the hotel And then we did our own walking tour of London ending up at a pub near the London Eye then taking a taxi back which was only about a 15 minute ride 2 hours walking and were able to see many nearby sites such as Hyde Park Harrods Buckingham Palace Big Ben Westminster Abbey London Eye and many places in between The property is old the room was very small and their is no A C but it is historic and in the lovely neighborhood of Kensington We felt safe and cozy and would definitely recommend this property again for short stays ,0,145,1
 The room was lovely and comforty just like we were wandering in our very own bedroom The prices are quite high but you really get all the bang for your bucks and very friendly staff at the desk for reception and eager to help you around localising your favourite places You also get a neat city map that has note of some cosy places to eat that are out of the overwhelming tourist area You re also straight in the heart of the 9 straatjes district of Amsterdam Best of the best Please do try and get a table at the restaurant down below it s well worth it They serve delicious italian food as well as classy cocktails and small side dishes and nibs it s always full so book in advance we we re very lucky to find a lonely corner ,0,145,1

 The breakfast although a little pricier than I expected was very nice and the was an array of selection to cater for everyone The staff the room and the general service was flawless The location was a little further out but still very central with a frequent tram stop just in front of the hotel we were in the City centre in 10 mins To compensate for the less than central location we were rewarded with fantastic views of the city and the nearby park made for a lovely place to go for a stroll and work out some of weight gained after having breakfast Other good points include the shuttle bus service from the airport to the hotel and the return journey there was a charge for this but it still worked cheaper and less hassle than a private cab public transport ,0,145,1

 Staff very friendly We were upgraded to a suite which was amazing I have never been upgraded for anything before it couldn t have happened at a better time for myself But even if we hadn t been upgraded the hotel is beautiful and I am sure that I would be giving the same review It is not a corporate type of hotel and as soon as you walk into the lobby it is welcoming and the decor is that of a Country Manor or was that just the fact that the Christmas trees and decorations made it feel like that I don t know but from start to finish our stay was superb The location is excellent for Kensington and Knightsbridge shopping but no matter where I am visiting in London from now on I shall be booking The Bailey s ,0,144,1

 Clean comfortable beds no noise from outside but unfortunately a herd of elephants in the room above around 1 2am Plenty of choice on the continental breakfast buffet and the staff all very helpful and friendly I thought the car park charge was a bit much 25 for a piece of spare space at the back but it was well secured Close to Wembley Arena which was the reason for our visit However the disabled wet room had a couple of minuses the shower floor should have had a rougher surface and I nearly slipped shower controls needed indication of what each was for as I got the full force on my head at one point and that was freezing Could have supplied a shower cap Disabled toilet pedestals are normally higher than provided there was no holder for toilet roll ,0,143,1

 Could not have asked for a better and a more comfortable stay in Paris In terms of location it doesn t get any better than this If you opt for a room with a view like we did then you get a view that is the envy of all Arc De Triomphe We did not opt for breakfast in the hotel since there are numerous patisseries and cafes around Despite arriving at the hotel way before our check in time the concierge accommodated us almost immediately The rooms are large by European standards very clean and airy i m talking about the rooms with a view Friendly and courteous staff added to our stay A special mention of Mr Farukh who floored us with his hospitality and generosity of ideas Thank you Splendid Etoile you truly made our stay Splendid ,0,142,1
 All the staff were friendly and efficient without exception The room small double was small but well equipped comfortable and stylish I loved the fur throw and the slightly surreal illuminated book spines the recharging points and extra cables were a nice touch The bathroom was pristine and the shower was enormous The teeny kitchenette was just what we needed and I wish my sink at home looked as shiny though a dishcloth might have helped me leave it tidier We asked for a quiet room and it really was quiet no disturbances at all honestly the most peaceful night s sleep I have ever had at a hotel This was an exploratory visit we were sizing the place up for a possible return to a Nadler with our child and dog and it certainly convinced us to do this ,0,142,1
 Absolutely stunning property in a very attractive location I was celebrating the birthday of my girlfriend and the staff really made our stay a memorable one We got upgraded to one the suites which was beautifully decorated with a great personal touch I have stayed at several 5 star hotels in London but must say that this hotel is my personal favourite so far The staff who were very friendly and helpful looked after us during the entire stay The bar is amazing serving Indian and Nepali beers you won t usually try elsewhere Most unique about this hotel is the building itself Previously a school building the rooms and restaurant are very unique with high ceilings and chic design Really enjoyed our stay and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to experience Indian hospitality at its finest ,0,142,1
 This hotel was brilliant The impression from the moment you walked in was that of a friendly and exciting environment Although it was self check in on the computers there was staff waiting to assist if you needed to and to have a little chat with about your plans The staff went above and beyond for us and it was very much appreciated The hotel is located not far from Southwalk Tube station so getting around London is easy Everything in the room was controlled via a tablet It was simple to use and fun There were free movies of which the selection were up to date and of good quality We paid a little more than we normally do for hotels but it was more than worth it I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying here ,0,142,1

 Overnight stay before attending Hammersmith Hospital for which it was well situated being a 10 taxi ride to the hospital at 6am in the morning Staff were very helpful and friendly although service in the restaurant became less attentive when it filled up Rooms were clean and had a fair amount of room but lighting was a little dim Room had aircon which was needed on a hot night but came with the expected background noise Sealed double glazed windows kept out the traffic noise as it is on the junction of some major mult laned roads Restaurant menu was ok but but the food was not outstanding although there was far too much of it I would happily stay again if I needed to be in that location although probably not if it was at the full room rate ,0,142,1
 I planned a quick trip to London to celebrate my 50th birthday and my daughter s golden birthday In order to make the trip seamless so that I could hit the ground running since it was such a short stay I contacted guest services a month in advance Marlen was exemplar and superior She facilitated all of my theater plans tour plans and transport needs I valued her effort to assist with the planning of the trip just as much or even more than the stay Upon arrival I had a fiftieth birthday cake and a personalized card When in a pinch Lauren arranged for some of my shopping needs to be met while I was out on a tour Lauren went the extra mile The wait staff was unusually kind and made us feel like guests in their homes ,0,142,1
 The location is fantastic in the heart of one of London s most charming neighborhoods you feel like a resident The hotel is decorated with great taste and they have paid careful attention to the details My room was on the smaller side but definitely suitable for one person I am a particularly light sleeper and found it to be very quiet and the bed is very comfortable The bathroom features modern fixtures and is decorated just the way I would decorate the bathroom in my own home The atmosphere of the common areas is very pleasant and the staff is welcoming and friendly There is a generous breakfast offering that includes a wide range of options I highly recommend this hotel I felt especially comfortable as a solo traveler I will definitely return during my future visits to London ,0,142,1
 The bed was by far the most comfiest bed I have ever slept on the hotel had an amazing smell through out with little air freshness puffing smells ever now and then the staff could speak English very well they were very helpful and polite Good value for money and it was right by a tram stop so it was so easy to get around with a straight route to the city The breakfast was all you can eat for 15 each which is very good value when you compare it to what you can get outside the hotel but we decided to go out for breakfast and explore so I cant make a judgment on the food but it looked and smelt nice Wouldn t go anywhere else will definitely be going back Nothing negative to say at all ,0,142,1
 Location location location If you re looking for a good location in Barcelona this hotel has got it Right on Las Ramblas and a block away from Plaza Catalunya you can literally walk anywhere to see all of the top attentions in Barcelona The rooms were modern and very clean small but that s every hotel room in Europe I had the option to have a room with the view of Las Ramblas for an extra 15 a night an option I didn t take but one that s really cheap for the view The staff is helpful and polite There is a restaurant attached to the hotel in which you can order breakfast for 15 I didn t do it because I like to try a different place every time I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona ,0,142,1

 Great location Lots of nearby restaurants and bars Hotel does not serve alcohol however there is a Sainsbury s opposite and a fridge provided in the room with glasses if you really can t go without There are so many bars within a minute or two s walk away that it did not matter at all Comfy bedroom with everything you need including good air con which actually works well and a bathroom which has space unusual for London Breakfast was excellent I can highly recommend the Eggs Royale and staff were friendly and courteous They do not serve pork products either but my husband loved the chicken herb sausages and turkey rashers instead Within walking distance to Tower Bridge St Catherine s dock area and Borough tube for access to central London Would definitely recommend and would stay again ,0,142,1
 I couldn t fault the service or quality of the hotel in general I booked this for my wife s 30th and the member of staff on check in sang a full rendition of Happy Birthday to her much to my young sons amusement Our son is 3 and daughter less than a year but not once did they feel anything other than welcome by the staff Even TV put on in a special kids area for breakfast if you wanted to use it Extra perk was if you had already booked breakfast with your stay you can have it in your room at no extra cost Turned up on a trolley which then was erected by the staff into a full table in our room Dine in style and comfort from your own bedroom Ideal after a night out ,0,142,1

 From arriving at the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful The guy behind the bar Mickayl i think was brilliant and helped with best directions to where we wanted to go The breakfast was good and plentiful and the staff in here were pleasant The hotel itself was in a good location 5 mins from Earls Court Tube station which was great for getting around London We were on the 5th floor of the hotel and it was very quiet the bathroom could have done with some tlc on the paintwork but nothing major the bar prices were reasonable with a pint of lager around 4 50 so not bad for London There is a Sainsburys just down the road which was great when we were unpacking on the Friday to find we had no toothpaste with us ,0,141,1
 This is a new hotel and it is very modern We were very impressed with the facilities including Sky TV in the room safe and minibar The bathroom was very clean and had a great shower including underfloor heating The room was operated by a very modern touch screen interface Great bar downstairs serving snacks and drinks with a couple of table games not sure what they were though There is also a restaurant at the top level with roof top bar which is impressive There is parking in a NCP right outside which is discounted by the hotel For a hotel of this standard I thought it was remarkably good value Breakfast was downstairs and good although fruit wasn t offered in this buffet although I think if asked for it would be supplied Can t fault it ,0,141,1
 This is by far the best hotel I ve ever stayed in and I have traveled a lot Everything was define from the comfy beds to the design to the extremely friendly and professional staff to how comfy it was for the children they absolutely loved it and made us promise to holiday in London again this year just so they could return to this hotel For me the bar was so cozy and nice the spa facilities well on the money I m still sleepy from the relaxing massage and facials I got yesterday lol Yes it is expensive to stay but it is a 5 star hotel with great value for money You will feel so good so much that you d forget you coughed out a mini fortune So staying here whenever I m in London ,0,141,1
 The location was very good The metro station is approx 450m away and the bus stop is only 100m away from the hotel We used the both Metro N 3 and Bus No 92 It was so convenient that we could buy the 10 pcs of tickets for EUR 14 50 Carnet for Metro Bus Train at Tabaco Shop around the corner 50m from hotel and Bus Stop is also approx 100m away We were upgraded to the 8th floor top floor and the view over the Paris city was great Considering that it s in Paris the room was not too small and it had a balcony Breakfast was also fine and coffee was very good The personal at the reception were very friendly and welcoming and we will of course stay here when we visit Paris again ,0,141,1

 The staff at the hotel were some of the most professional and helpful i have come across in a hotel Nothing was too much trouble for them to make our stay as comfortable as possible and the reccomendations that the hotel concierge made were excellent The hotel is in a great location being a stones throw away from the Lourve and nearby to some nearby cafes and bars We had a superior rom and the facilities were very good The shower was great with a large monsoon shower head as well as an additional detachable shower for me the bed and the shower can make or break a hotel The bed was very comfortable and the hotel was very peaceful so we slept very well both nights Also really good to see a full length mirror in the room ,0,141,1
 We were looking for a hotel that was quirky and a bit different and CitizenM did not disappoint Located literally on top of Tower Hill Station it really is a 2 minute walk We arrived early and were able to leave our luggage to go enjoy our day and head back later to check in Check in was smooth and you re able to choose your own room on arrival from those available we were lucky to get a Tower of London view which was amazing The room was controlled completely by iPad temperature lighting TV curtain and blind The bed is extra large and was right up against the window so comfy The whole stay was brilliant and we are currently looking into their other hotels for our next trip P S The coffee in reception is amazing ,0,141,1
 The bed is a large Emperor size perfect to have enough room to stretch out if need be The size of the room and the facilities included are effectively used and made you feel comfortable and not cramped The addition of an iPad to control all aspects of lighting and tv was an added bonus We also told the hotel it was our 7 year anniversary celebration when hearing this they left free drink vouchers for the bar on the 7th floor of the hotel It was a lovely surprise to find when we entered the room and certainly fantastic for the staff to have remembered when I initially booked If you do stay here please go and visit the bar at the 7th Floor the view of the Tower of London Tower Bridge and the Shard are spectacular ,0,141,1
 Booked a double room for 5 nights Asked for a twin room at check in and they obliged Yayy The location is near 2 different tube lines with many cafes restaurants and even grocery shops nearby The Westfield shopping mall will have everything that you would need The room is snug but large enough to lay out 2 suitcases Air conditioned kettle cups fridge hair dryer provided WiFi was good The bathroom was excellent One of my pet peeves are shower areas that do not contain water well with the floor ending up wet and slippery no matter how you contort in the shower The shower stall was well thought out and constructed and I absolutely loved not having the floor wet when my friend have used it The beds were ok but the pillows were a bit soft ,0,141,1
 We enjoyed our stay in this pleasant hotel in Barcelona The staff were pleasant and extremely helpful upon arrival one of us was ill and they helped us get into the room in advance of check in time The next day when we needed medical attention they called the doctor and made sure the doctor was able to speak English since our Spanish was limited They also booked our transportation to the airport Excellent customer service and care It was easy to find this location as it is on a main street Even though around the corner there is some grafitti we felt safe in this area It s a short walk 5 10min to La Sagrada so it s convenient to see it multiple times of the day Easily accessible by taxi or the metro system as well ,0,141,1

 Trafalgar Square Club Quarters is a very impressive hotel From the outset I am a great fan of ClubQuarters CQ and stay often in their various London hotels on business trips This was my first stay at the Trafalgar Sq hotel and all the staff and facilities were welcoming and helpful The room was quite large for London standards Superior Queen and this CQ was more old European hotel in flavour as opposed to the more modern style CQ elsewhere in the capital Staff were all excellent Ophelia and Dan in particular at Reception were very kind and professional I certainly would recommend and stay there again But then I would recommend all of CQ in London Standards and Management is high and supportive They care about their guests and it shows because we return all the time ,0,140,1
 For an Australian travelling by herself this proved to be in a brilliant location to easily reach all tourist attractions Staff were super friendly and helpful particularly Lutta rooms are very comfortable and in an older Viennese style Do not stay here if you want super modern and ultra stylish but I would highly recommend if you want to experience a little bit of older world grace and charm albeit a little outdated Great breakfasts with eggs cooked on request which was great Very helpful also in storing luggage before and after checkout with great facilities for washing up if your room is not ready or you have already checked out Bathroom was generous beds large and linen clean and crisp Room was reasonably quiet Certainly no street noise and I felt very safe at night Highly recommend ,0,140,1

 The position of the hotel is just great walking distance from London Bridge Shard Borough Market etc and very well connected also by bus for example to go to London Waterloo The area is very pretty with lots of local coffee shops restaurant and trendy pubs Despite the area it is not noisy and pretty well isolated being located in a tiny nice square where on Friday and Saturday mornings there is a small market The room is very well furnished with also a small beauty area hairdryer nice and wide mirror with led lights Big bathroom and good wifi connection We did not try the breakfast in the hotel but there are plenty of coffee shops in the area one just on the corner in front of the hotel where you can have great coffee and food ,0,140,1
 My husband experienced a medical emergency Sied sp the night manager was extremely helpful He got us a taxi and told the taxi driver to take us to the hospital We had no idea where we were going Sied sent us to the best hospital in London Sied also helped cancel our reservations at our next stop on our travels which took a great burden off our minds While my husband was in the hospital Sied was very helpful getting a cab for me early in the mornings and he was very kind and supportive He seemed to sense my worry and took effort to encourage me The staff was also very accomdating in extending our stay We were so fortunate to have chosen this hotel for its beauty comfort location and service We highly recommend it ,0,139,1
 I LOVED this hotel The staff is extremely nice and helpful They also had a service called handy which allowed you to use the cellphone to access the cellular data for maps or searching online without being connected to wifi This tool was absolutely amazing and really helpful in navigating the city I was able to quickly google map my route instead of pulling out a hard copy of the map to figure out how to get from point a to point b The rooms are small which is to be expected in Europe The beds were super comfortable The hotel is also in a great location just a short walk to the central line which is what I used most frequently during my stay I would absolutely stay here again on my next visit to London ,0,139,1
 The staff were incredible Once my boyfriend mentioned that it was my birthday they went above and beyond to make it a very special day Our room was upgraded and we received a complimentary breakfast and dinner The bed was comfy and the room was airy thanks to air conditioning The only slightly off putting thing about the room was that it had two massive mirrors facing the bed I understand this was done to make the room look bigger but it was slightly disconcerting to wake up and look straight in the mirror The hotel is a bit difficult to navigate but the staff are very helpful and made sure we found our way to the pool which is lovely The location is very near public transport and busses go regularly back to the tube station ,0,139,1
 My husband and I stayed here recently and I must say it was excellent It was only a 10 min walk from Paddington with tube stations within a very short walking distance So great for location We were originally given a ground floor room that looked out at a blank wall Not the view of London we really wanted However as soon as I said we really would prefer a different room the staff were very good and moved us straight away The staff were excellent throughout and our room was tastefully decorated with a large bed and a fantastic rain shower We only booked for the continental breakfast but my husband upgraded to the full breakfast for 5 and had a beautiful big cooked breakfast too We loved staying here and would definitely use it again ,0,139,1
 My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel between 21st 24th Decmber On check in the front desk staff were very helpful they spoke English and assisted us with our luggage The room was small typical for Paris but very clean and practical The front desk staff printed off our tour vouchers for us and gave us some advice on nice places to eat around the local area The location of this hotel is perfect Round the corner from the world famous Champs Elysee but yet still very quiet and peaceful There is a Metro station about 200yrds from the hotel entrance and a newsagents type shop 10seconds away Breakfast was good but I did expect a little more choice of hot food My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be returning ,0,139,1
 To be fair we didn t have a lot of time at the hotel I liked the bedroom 1930 s style it was large and comfortable It is in a great location and suited our needs perfectly We went to the bar after the theatre it had a smooth ambience but the drinks were expensive compared to Babylon Kensington Roof Gardens In order to make use of some of the facilities I to planned to go for a swim before breakfast but found the pool wasn t open until 10 00 am disappointing We didn t have the executive lounge explained to us so have no idea what that was all about but can be found on floor E via the lift A pleasant enough stay but will probably try another hotel in the vicinity next time ,0,139,1
 We were a grandmother and grandson travelling around Europe together and our stay at this hotel was exceptional There is nothing that did not please us The Staff were exceptional polite courteous attentive and considerate The Hotel room was perfect and large and clean The pools were terrific and we can not say enough good reports It is ideally located within two minutes walk from the metro that takes one straight into the heart of the city It is about a twenty minute ride by metro to the city centre The Hotel is airy and whilst it is clearly designed for families in mind this was not a problem regarding a noise element The pool area was large and the playground for small children more than enough The weather was perfect and we cannot wait to return ,0,139,1
 Our stay at the INK Hotel was delightful The location is very central an easy walk to the train station and there is a GBV tram stop right outside the front door The staff was quite helpful and pleasant When we checked in they were having system problems but they worked quickly to resolve them We were in Room 501 for our thirteen night stay which was marvelous It has a high pitched ceiling with exposed beams It was almost like staying in a beautifully renovated Dutch apartment It was extremely quiet and the bed was very comfortable The WiFi throughout the hotel is quite fast One of the employees Sri was especially welcoming and friendly He gave us some great recommendations for restaurants and we always enjoyed interacting with him when entering or leaving the hotel ,0,139,1

 The staff were amazing and so kind and thoughtful they made our stay in the hotel a wonderful experience sending up a bottle of champagne on arrival for my boyfriends birthday Barcelona itself as beautiful as it is was not so kind to us we were robbed on our first night Then the following day we were supposed to see Barcelona v Villareal we bought match tickets online before we left for our holiday but when we got to the stadium we were told they were invalid and someone else had already arrived in the stadium with the same tickets There were quite a few ppl around us that this had happened to so be careful if purchasing online We left Barcelona feeling pretty downhearted but we kept telling each other at least the hotel was great ,0,139,1
 We had just one night in London and the hotel s location let us make the most of it Took the tube directly from Heathrow no transfers and found the hotel right around the corner from the Russell Square tube station The next day it was an easy walk to St Pancras Station to catch the train to Gatwick We spent our day in London eating shopping and visiting the British Museum everything within extremely easy walking distance Grand old hotel with updated comfortable rooms and magnificent public spaces It occupies nearly a block and the hallways are quite long and could probably be updated but the rooms are very pleasant indeed Stayed on a Sunday night when the room rates were exceptionally low they re much higher the rest of the week Charming doorman too ,0,138,1
 The room was nicely decorated with enough room for what we wanted Heating was great Breakfast was great too The hotel was right next to one of the Ledru Rollin metro entrances and a short walk away from the Bastille station which made it very easy to travel within the city or get to the train station to go to Disney There is also a bike rental rack right in front of the hotel if you want to use that the Navigo pass makes it cheap to use everything If when we go back we will most likely stay at this hotel again If you re on a budget there s a Mac and Subway and a Monoprix and Dia Supermarket right around the corner You can easily PIC stuff up for a picnic along the Sienne,0,138,1

 I absolutely loved the staff everyone was so accomodating and friendly The hotel was a small boutique hotel located on a side street across from a park and train station and in the heart of everything you would want cafes parks restaurants shopping and a short walk to the monuments and other districts Our room was really tiny for two people but it was clean and cute and it overlook the park a perfect view The elevator made us laugh because it was soooo small only one person with luggage or two people could fit at a time No complaints on our end The staff eas very catering and gave us information and called a taxi every time to get us to where we wanted to go I would definitely recommend for the price AWESOME ,0,137,1
 This is a very lovely hotel old fashioned yet with modern amenities Staff are fantastic and very helpful and certainly care about their guests Room Service very good with marvellous quality food The courtyard is a great hideaway to read or have coffee or a cigar Free wifi which is fine but you have to pay for high speed if you want to watch Netflix for example which is kind of an outdated concept these days There are some hidden charges nothing shocking but be mindful to check your bill before checking out As is usual with hotels they will say to book direct for the best rates but this is never true Book via this site always Overall a very good hotel great staff certainly should be in the top list of London hotels ,0,137,1
 The hotel is right in front of a subway station so it made our way from the airport pretty easy We got there and everybody was extremely nice the room had a nice city view although we d have chosen the sea view if we d had known better the frigobar was free Not even after 10 minutes in the room we received a super welcoming gift a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries We told them in advance we were celebrating our anniversary and they were lovely The restaurant in front of the swimming pool was also delicious and cheap We had many amazing tapas and draft beer enjoying the sun and the pool view It s also right next to a mall with good stores and restaurants for a quick meal ,0,137,1
 There is absolutely nothing negative to report on this property From the moment you enter the hotel the fairy tale begins The receptionists are eager to please and explain about restaurants in the city directions help with US mobile phones etc they are knowledgeable The beds are like clouds the room is very spacious and the bathroom is beautiful heated floors and a very spacious shower The breakfast is elaborate and well prepared We had dinner twice in the restaurant lunch once absolutely superb The waiters and waitresses are again very friendly and knowledgeable I could not recommend this property enough We met two Englishmen in the hotel and they raved about it too We are definitely planning to return to this fabulous hotel in a very wonderful city It s a WIN WIN Enjoy ,0,137,1
 My husband and I had a wonderful stay the staff were lovely and the facilities were first rate We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet it offered enormous choice and excellent quality In addition I would also like to thank the hotel staff for facilitating our trip to Sagrada Familia we had not booked in advance so did not manage to get in to the basilica at the beginning of our holiday We subsequently discovered that the hotel could help and needed two days notice to book us on a tour The service was brilliant and enabled us to go to the fabulous church on our last day I really can t recommend this hotel enough My husband and I are already planning a return trip to Barcelona and can t wait to stay there again ,0,137,1
 All of the staff were welcoming helpful and professional They provided excellent advice directions and recommendations The bartender in the gorgeous roof top patio made us the best mojitos we re every had Hotel Palace is upmarket formerly the Ritz but the staff were not the least but snooty Our room was wonderful on the 4th floor a corner room overlooking the main street It was luxurious and beautiful The decor throughout is elegant and tasteful The bathroom was stunning We also found the location very good for our walks through beautiful neighbourhoods and close to many of the main sites of Barcelona We took cabs to Gruell Park and one distant restaurant but other than that all was within walking distance I hope to return to Barcelona and I wouldn t stay anywhere else ,0,137,1
 The Mandeville Hotel is perfectly situated in Westminster London Though our stay was a brief overnighter we thoroughly enjoyed the hotels amenities The Reception staff were very kind and personable the Concierge staff were as helpful as could be no questions asked went unanswered especially regarding sites and attractions of interest to a visitor The on site restaurant staff were equally kind and personable and they served up an excellent dinner with a very nice menu and good wine The breakfast buffet was delicious and quite adequate a great way to begin the day Our room was clean comfy and quiet that s really nice when one is travel weary The bed was especially comfortable We will stay here again on a future trip to London and highly recommend to others Thanks Mandeville You rock ,0,137,1
 Me and my friend who are both students stayed here for 1 night The hotel is nice clean and modern It offers good facilities great breakfast and decent rooms Me and my friend got back to our room late after a long night in the city This is when we noticed that our air con did not work Along with the heat our room was also placed close to the ground facing the central station This meant that all the trams that went past the hotel would make extremely loud noises as well as give a shaking sensation to our room which made it hard to sleep We would have asked for a new room if we would have noticed these flaws earlier but decided to just go with it and try to catch some sleep,0,137,1
 hotel was beautiful elegant and clean and the staff were extremely helpful they couldn t do enough for you Rooms nicely decorated with gorgeous bathroom The bath was huge and the separate shower was very powerful The rooms had everything you needed TV Safe Hairdryer UK Adapter in the safe good quality irons available We had a lovely Balcony too Staff English was great and they couldn t do enough for you Bar Small for the size of the hotel but it wasn t busy and had a lovely atmosphere Pool didn t use it but it looked GORGEOUS Although not right in the centre it was in a good location in that just around the corner there was a supermarket and some cafes that were all very cheap if you are on a budget ,0,137,1
 I stayed at The Bryson Hotel for one night with my boyfriend and we enjoyed our stay very much We wanted to do some sightseeing and shopping in London and the Location of this brand new hotel was brilliant There are 2 underground stations with main lines and also buses to the city centre every 5 minutes and it only takes another 10min to be in Oxford Circus The British and Dickens Museum Covent Garden Leicester Square Piccadilly Old Street Liverpool street I was amazed how close everything was The Hotel was lovely it is a Brand New one and everything looks so clean tidy and fresh Our bathroom was big and spacious The bed very comfortable and the toiletries very nice Staff was very helpful I do hope we can go back soon ,0,136,1
 This hotel was in a great location between 2 main subway stations the bus stop and also by the Tower Bridge and the boat station But this hotel was so special because of the wonderful staff Max Rebecca Sarah Annya and Chris all helped to make my first time to London an extra special trip for me Helping me with information and service above and beyond and always so warm and friendly The rooms were wonderfully decorated and extremely clean This hotel has a restaurant and bar attached very convenient and the food is excellent I would recommend this hotel to anyone and if I visit London again this is where I will stay I believe it is one of the top 3 hotels in the world that I have stayed at Just AWESOME ,0,136,1
 We booked this very last minute on the afternoon of arrival so we got a great deal online with Booking com engineering works on the trains that weekend would have made our journey home impossible so we treated ourselves to an overnight stay in London after a party The room was nicely decorated recently so I believe and the bathroom was well equipped Nice to have a full sized bath with shower over Lovely big comfy bed The rate didn t include breakfast and I m sure it would have been delicious but it was bit expensive for us so we found a lovely little cafe around the corner in the morning instead Excellent location with the Tube cafes and restaurants all within a minute s walk We d definitely like to stay again ,0,136,1
 I booked this as a surprise for my beloved I arrived early to check in and was delighted to receive a complimentary upgrade to a suite later we were treated to a bottle of Prosecco to celebrate our special night The iconic building is ultra modern and every detail of our stay was perfect from the incredibly comfortable massive bed which was like sleeping on clouds to the super soft bathrobes the Hermes toiletries plus the fantastic use of modern technology that allowed us to customise everything in the room including mood lighting and underfloor heating Our time spent in the indoor pool jacuzzi and steam room provided the perfect way to unwind from the stress of the cold grey London reality outside All the staff were wonderful the service was absolutely first class ,0,136,1
 The duplex junior suite they gave us no 42 was located on ground floor next to the patio ensuring very quiet nights and that in the center of the city Moreover for the moderate smoker that I am it was very convenient to just open the back door and light a shag on the patio The suite itself was spacious and warmly decorated redolent with the history of an old palace on the other hand the bathroom and the restroom are a bit too reminiscent of old days and could use a little refurbishing Nice 15m indoor swimming pool and hammam They should provide a few more hot showers in the Spa with more of those Occitane en Provence products as in the guest rooms Great continental breakfast with fresh grapefruit juice every morning ,0,136,1
 Firstly if you are coming from CDG Airport the RoissyBus arrives about 2 minutes walk from the hotel strongly recommended The hotel itself is spotless and welcoming in a reasonably quiet side street given its central location The room was large and comfortable and the bathroom modern and extremely clean Breakfast in the room was excellent although we did not try the breakfast buffet Our room had a small terrace definitely worth the extra if the weather is likely to be good Plenty of places to eat within five minutes of the hotel and close to Printemps and Galeries Lafayette for some luxury shopping or just looking We were also able to leave our luggage there on the morning of our departure since we didn t need to get the bus back until midday ,0,136,1
 Someone with taste and style has decorated this property the rich wood trim tasteful paintings clean white bedding modern bathroom plumbing all made the property beautiful and my stay there felt like a treat Their best advantage is they are on a quiet side street a couple of short blocks from a nice busy street full of public transport options and helpful businesses for travelers restaurants shops ATMs Plus they are a short walk to the beautiful Kensington park and within an easy walk of at least three tube stations including the very useful Notting Gate Hill circle line connecting to lots of London touristy things A couple of comfort things I especially valued were the room air conditioner not a given in many London hotels very appreciated in summer and the lift elevator ,0,136,1
 My family and I booked the Triple Room at Hotel Monsieur and it was super comfortable The room was HUGE by Parisian standards and was more of a suite including a terrace perfect for breakfast not that advantageous in winter though when we were there The bath is the best the shower head is strong We also had a Nespresso machine The location is perfect for shoppers since Haussmann and Galeries Lafayette are a close walk away Saint Augustin station is about 300 meters away and includes a line that is well connected to almost all the main lines All in all the room and the hotel are very nice a fresh change from all the hotels around Paris with the outdated styles and the rust Highly recommended Thanks to the Hotel Monsieur team ,0,136,1
 When you stay at the Caf Royal you will expect first of all a high class hotel service The hotel staff is an enrichment for this five star hotel they are extremly friendly and willing to satisfy every wish from you The room I had was very clean and neat Although the Caf Royal is located on the busy Regent Street and a stone s throw away from Piccadilly Circus I didn t hear any noise in the room I can highly recommend a visit to their Akasha Spa Nice pool and a variety of Spa treatments If you are looking for a very fine dine seafood restaurant I can recommend Scott s restaurant on the 20th Mount Street I will definitely stay again at the Caf Royal when I am back in London ,0,136,1
 This place is now among my top 10 favorite hotels worldwide and I ve been to quite a few I Had one night in Amsterdam on a layover I found this place among the top 20 on Trip Adviser so clicked to reserve on the short train ride from the airport to the city I loved the whole vibe and style of the place Great location about 15 min walk from the Central Train Station or a 9 euro Uber ride They upgraded me to a beautiful spacious room overlooking the canal The design is pretty hip and modern but all spaces are warm and inviting with attention to lighting The price for a bottle of wine to go at the front desk was unheard of at 10 and it was actually pretty decent ,0,136,1
 The location of the hotel was brilliant just 5 minutes away from Amsterdam central and 10 minutes away from the airport The train was easy enough to navigate your way there and back which was great for us first timers The hotel is easy to locate in a quiet and safe place which was brilliant The room was amazing we had superior had a beautiful view with a great bathroom especially the shower The room was always cleaned when asked and being able to adjust the temperature in the room was a bonus The hotels cleanliness was spot on and the staff were friendly and always there to help with giving directions and maps to help find your way around Amsterdam I honestly have nothing bad to say and would definitely recommend to anyone ,0,136,1
 The service and more importantly the attitude toward service was exemplary We really liked the room and how carefully it was engineered to provide the best comfort using every little space and loading it with something extra We loved our room overlooking the Opera House And how close it was to just walk to the Opera for a performance We loved the extra special delivery of sweets frequently to the room and the lovely lamb cake and chocolate eggs for Easter It was very festive Although many of the staff were superb Sabrina was outstanding and really cared a lot about our stay The Blue Bar is chic and elegant The Anna Sacher restaurant was exquisite for our Easter dinner The food was excellent and the restaurant has an extensive and good wine list ,0,136,1
 The Glam Hotel is placed near the railway station and has a subway station in front of it It was a great location for us because we stayed five days in Milan but three days we travelled by train to lakes The room was nice very clean with a great view over the railway station market especially in the evening when the lights were on Wifi worked good The staff was friendly and helpful During this trip it was the first time when we were stuck in the elevator We called the front desk and since we announced it they let us free in a really short time The breakfast and dinner have been included in the room price Both were very good very tasty and we could choose between a lot of dishes ,0,136,1
 The room was a great size and the bathroom too It was a double room but we had two comfy double beds which was an added bonus and a seating area too Also we had fantastic views as we were on the 8th floor as there was 3 windows and it was nice and airy when we needed it to be I was in London as a present from my husband for my 40th Birthday present and just after we arrived at our room they arrived with 2 slices of gorgeous carrot cake with the inscription happy birthday so that was a really nice touch Overall a lovely hotel very central very near Holborn tube station very near covent garden 5 mins walk for the markets there and the fab restaurants and bars there ,0,136,1
 The staff here could not be more helpful From the moment we arrived we were treated really well Both rooms were upgraded for free which was a lovely touch as some of our guests were new to amsterdam and had never stayed in a W Hotel before We found the drinks prices really reasonable in the bar and the staff seemed to make the effort to remember what drinks we liked to order They also would make an effort to use our names when we arrived left daily The rooms are really beautiful and the design of this hotel is lovely When I go back to Amsterdam I will 100 be staying here again This is also the best location is the perfect spot as it is near everything you need to get to ,0,136,1
 Read the reviews if this hotel after booking and was worried but it was wonderful Rooms were decorated beautifully and huge I booked twin beds and were given two doubles Bathroom was lovely free mini bar free to use safe great thick curtains to shut out the light Used the restaurant once but although nice the menu wasn t my taste fussy eater Breakfast was faultless so much choice can t see why anyone would disagree Right next to Metro so easy to explore Milan This hotel probably my best yet in the last year of travelling for work Very pet friendly too with non carpeted rooms Can t wait to go says me who s fussy about everything If I had one complaint that would be no kettle but I carry one anyway ,0,136,1
 The room was fab very modern with a free mini bar and nepresso machine who can complain They also gave you robes and slippers to make you feel extra fancy after your fabulous shower They had little favours everywhere in our room which really makes your stay here special It is a little out from the centre walk wise but with the no4 tram outside the door u can hop on and off it outside all the main areas it was amazing I would recommend getting a ticket that would do you the length of your stay because its 3 euros a pop and you would be surprised how it can tot up Also literally minutes walk to the sign museums and heineken experience And in all i reckon I would stay here again ,0,136,1
 When we arrived we mentioned it was our daughters 3rd bday and they upgraded us to the penthouse immediately just because and when we got to the room there was a birthday message on the window a card and balloons in the room it made our weekend this penthouse has the best views of London I have ever seen best room we ve ever stayed in by far Sadly our 3 year old got sick and we had to stay an extra night and the hotel were able to move us into another room straight away sadly she was sick on the covers and we asked for new sheets whilst apologising the staff were more than understanding and kind to us and we can t thank the hotel enough the staff were incomparable ,0,135,1
 Cute little boutique hotel one block off of the Champs lys es I m sure we had the smallest room but it was clean with a new small bathroom and we were in Paris in an old building so did not expect or want a modern North American hotel Walking distance to Louvre 15 20 mins walked to the Eiffel Tower 10 15 mins Many many restaurants close by And shops every which way you turned Great for just window shopping in the evenings too Never felt unsafe in the area Front staff were courteous and helpful with all our questions Always a taxi or 2 waiting just across the street from the entrance to the hotel We did not have the breakfast offered I would return to this hotel and recommend it ,0,135,1
 The staff were AMAZING everyone was so kind and helpful from the first employee who checked me in a very nice Italian young lady at the reception to the lovely staff in the dining room a young man from Manchester also the young lady from Spain who checked me out My room was sparkling clean even though it was small if was so cozy with coffee and tea a small fridge and a great selection on the flat screen The breakfast was delicious with a large selection of hot and cold items Also I loved the location of the hotel so convenient from Heathrow restaurants and to museums I normally don t like to stay in the same hotels but I definitely will stay at this establishment on my next trip to London ,0,135,1
 This hotel is conveniently located by a stop for the 2 tram which goes to the Centraal Station the train station for Amsterdam The tram trip to Centraal Station takes about half an hour and the trams run frequently The hotel also has a parking structure for those driving by car and they rent bicycles Central Amsterdam is very suitable for pedestrians and bicyclists and not so suitable for cars so it make sense to take the tram in and walk or bicycle The hotel s breakfast buffet is excellent It is slightly cheaper 12 5 euros instead of 15 euros if you book it in advance the night before Thus hotel s WiFi is excellent which is not true of all of the moderately priced hotels in Europe where I have stayed ,0,135,1
 We thoroughly enjoyed our stay From arrival to departure the staff were absolutely fabulous Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful ranging from the staff at the reception area the people cleaning the rooms and the really happy breakfast team Although our room was small it was really cosy and had everything we needed a view of the canal a comfy bed and a shower room that provided us with lots of boiling hot water whenever we needed it The open bar and cheese selection during the late afternoon period was always a welcome delight to return to If planning another trip to Amsterdam we would without hesitation book this hotel again Its proximity to the galleries the shopping areas and excellent restaurants was a huge bonus and we were able to walk everywhere ,0,135,1
 We had a great extended weekend I Milano When we arrived the room wasn t ready so we were offered a drink in the bar And a helpful concierge came over and gave us some advice on what to do and where to eat during our stay We were really Impressed by the great breakfast with a lot of choices loved it With the convenient location close to almost everything we can recommend this hotel On my birthday I got a voucher for a free drink When in the bar the staff surprised me with cake and prosecco in addition to the drinks for my husband and me A bit on the expensive end of the price scale but as this was a special weekend we went for it And never regretted it ,0,135,1
 To my surprise the Hotel is SciFi themed I was greeted by R2D2 when entering the hotel and the they paid attention to details Even the fonts used for all the signage is close to the ones used in the Star Wars movies The hallways look like right out of a starship and even the elevator doors are painted like the doors in the movie The hotel is conveniently located on top of the Sants railway station so right from the hotel one has access to all public transport Also a huge taxi waiting area is located there so it is never a problem to pick up a taxi And all taxi drivers know the hotel and therefore are able to take you there The staff are friendly helpful and speak good english ,0,135,1
 Me and my husband stayed for three nights and felt so happy with this hotel The location is only 10 minutes walking from Luxembourg RER Station and also surrounded by fancy stores mini market and some interesting places e g Palais du Luxembourg and Odeon Theatre The room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable The best thing about the room was the view We asked to have a best view room when we checked in and the staff gave us a room on the 6th floor with stunning view of Eiffel Tower don t worry be happy they have an elevator Another good thing about this hotel was its short distance to a good Indonesian restaurant named Indonesia Really worth a try please google the location for details ,0,134,1
 Just by chance I hit upon a hotel with a history It appears to be a small hotel with an amazing story The lower floors have wonderful wood panelling and scultured wood over the doors and stained glass leaded windows The breakfast rooms have beautiful moulded ceilings however my single bedroom was ultra modern Apparently Edward 7th bought this house for his mistress Lilly Langtry and had a small theatre and bar installed which are very ornate and intimate The hotel is in an excellent position being near Queensway Tube Station on the Bayswater Road and right opposite Kensington Gardens and about 6 minutes walk from the Palace It took me 45 minutes to walk through the Gardens and across Hyde Park passing the Serpentine and Rotten Row to reach Marble Arch ,0,134,1
 I have to be honest this was my first time going to Paris so I was very nervous about choosing a hotel online I was looking for a hotel close to some of the museums but not in the heart of the city with ALL this hustle bustle Just as important I wanted a hotel that had employees that spoke English and was very clean especially the bathroom I m very picky This hotel surpassed all my expectations Not only was is right down the street from the Louvre and the Musse D Orsay but it was close to great restaurants and the staff was amazing Very polite and helpful It was a breath of fresh air and I recommend it highly I would without a doubt stay there again Thumbs up ,0,134,1
 The overall stay was excellent upon arrival we were promptly meet and our luggage taken and checked in whilst offered complimentary drinks Room upgrades were given as we were celebrating a friends birthday and the hotel had made a cake and placed a free bottle of bubbly in the room arranged by Daisy the Assistant House Manager Service from staff was exceptional and the rooms very clean and comfortable During 5 30 7 30 the complimentary services in Club Lounge were very satisfactory Breakfast was in lovely surroundings and exceptional standard Our stay was fault less and we will be returning in the summer as a consequence having stayed at many hotels even the higher rated for facilities don t always get service right but the Montcalm had everything expected and more ,0,134,1
 Lovely boutique hotel great location about 10 minutes to Notre Dame and only a few minutes walk to a number of Metro stations Interior is very fresh a stylish fusion of traditional and contemporary decor Beds and bedding are high quality and although you can sometimes hear the Metro nearby it is not intrusive Nice view over the amphitheatre at the back I believe there is a sauna for use by guests but we didn t find this out until we got there Plenty of great bistros nearby worth a little walk up to Place de la Contrescarpe 5 minutes West of the hotel nice bars and restaurants The museum of natural history and zoo M nagerie le zoo du Jardin des Plantes are about 5 minutes East and worth a visit ,0,134,1
 For 2 days we really felt like a princess prince form a fairy tail or beauty and the beast Entering the hotel Tasha really made us feel at home She gave us a very warm welcome professional and to the point The room was luxurious with eye for detail The spa excellent and the breakfast what can is say just delicious Concierge James was extremely helpful map guides great choice in booking restaurant for us and even leaving entering the hotel was a nice experience because of bellboy Jerome In my opinion the room is important but it s the service that makes the real difference In this hotel everybody loves their job and it reflects on fairy tail service they provide Many thanks to make us feel like royalty Mrs Mr Dilissen,0,134,1
 I stayed at the hotel for my hen party I was with 13 others ages ranging from 20 s to 70 The hotel catered for us all perfectly The hotel staff were really friendly and got us checked in as fast as possible The hotel is lovely looking very modern and clean We spent most of our time drinking fizz by the pool it was heaven The rooms are spacious we had 3 to a room there was a very large bathroom mirror which enabled us all to get ready together The breakfast in the hotel is amazing well worth the money if you book it for 3 days it s 13 instead of 15 They also serve cava with breakfast The hotel is a very short walk to the gorgeous beach ,0,134,1
 I enjoyed an absolutely fabulous stay here Every single staff member that I encountered be it at the front desk the breakfast area or the night doorman was super friendly Small things such as the rose that you receive at check in and which bloomed more beautifullly every day of my week long stay and not being able to pass the reception desk without being acknowledged and greeted make you feel truly appreciated as a guest I stayed in a small double room but I didn t feel trapped in a back closet which the added small made me fear On the contrary the room was very comfortable with sufficient space a good bed and a stylish bathroom I ll definitely come back to this hotel if I ever visit Milan again ,0,134,1
 The hotel is very close to transports Tram Train Bus gets you to the city in minutes or outside of town via Sprinters Train Transports are not expensive especially if you use the IAmsterdam Card The room was very clean and tidy nice and warm facilities little to no noise from the outside beautiful bathroom with all facilities roomy and nice bed for a young couple The Stodyjk station nearby has some stores a supermarket and some take away food stores to help in times of need The meals and view from the restaurant topside are very nice a short yet very well prepared and cooked list of dishes is available We ve not enjoyed but it has also a bar that allows to have a nice cocktail while resembling Amsterdam city ,0,134,1
 The Luxury Suites is the most magical place as soon as you step inside you are in a different world Simply phenomenal I would love to live in the penthouse we stayed in forever The staff are the most pleasant professional charmingly lovely people and the owner should be proud of the 7 star service they provided us with Complimentary champagne as a birthday treat as well as the suite being personally decorated for my celebration s I would recommend this establishment all day long to anyone and everyone who s listened to my amazing birthday spent in Amsterdam at this magnificent wonderful beautiful place we call THE LUXURY SUITES I want to thank ALL of the staff that made our stay more amazing than I could have ever imagined AyDan x ,0,134,1
 The service was first class The staff was kind and friendly Check in was flawless A hotel employee walked us to our room and explained the various features of the room The bathroom was beautiful with marble d cor and plenty of bath products by Atelier Good size room and very comfortable beds The bed turn down service which included a sample of Atelier Cologne placed on your pillow a different scent each night was a very nice touch The wifi connection was excellent The roof top patio had fantastic views of the city including the Sagrada Familia A great place to enjoy the Barcelona sun and some sangrias The hotel was very close to many attractions including the Gaudi houses shopping and the Barcelona tourist bus Hoping to return next year ,0,134,1
 This hotel was perfect for a 1 night stay I was travelling to and from by train and the hotel is extremely convenient located just across the street from the main station The room was clean and basic and looked like it was recently remodelled The bed was fine A little bit of street noise nothing unexpected One particularly nice thing was the half board which means buffet dinner and breakfast included If on vacation I m sure many people would prefer to check out some of the local cuisine but for a quick stay or work trip this is very convenient There was a good selection with options for people who don t eat dairy or wheat It wasn t advertised as such but they were there I would stay again ,0,134,1
 I really enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel The staff is wonderful accommodations quite comfortable The electronic control panel for lights and temperature is a little tricky to figure out but once you know the secret there aren t any issues The pricing on spa services was very reasonable in my opinion The location is great if you are there for a conference at the CCIB as it is directly across the street and Diagonal Mar a large shopping mall is also across the street There are quite a few quick eateries in the area as well and it s just a quick walk to some of the beaches You will need to take the metro or tram both stops close by or a taxi to downtown and to go sightseeing however ,0,134,1
 arrived at 15 15 check in is at 15 00 room was not ready were told that the room would be ready in 30 minutes and that we would be called after an hour no call so went to check then waited another 15 for the room then the room cool corner suit had an obstructed view most of the view was the roof of another building The room wasn t cleaned the next day so we had to call reception and only then did they come and clean it WhatsApp service that was offered for 24 7 service was bad used it once and didn t get a reply for over an hour Room service did not bring all the requested items overall disappointing for a 5 star hotel at this price,0,134,1
 throughout our stay the staff were really friendly and made sure we were happy with every little detail I had contacted them beforehand to ask for a few little touches to be added to the room to make it all the more special and they fulfilled this in the loveliest of ways rose petals on the bed cupcakes and a card We loved the way the room functioned through tablets and couldn t get enough of the lighting in the bedroom and the underfloor heating in the bathroom It came with everything we could need and more Not only was it stunning on the eye but also especially comfortable and clean too We had a hard time leaving this spot of luxury behind so will be sure to stay here again ,0,133,1
 We love this place so so so much Upon the arrival and during our stay the ambassadors were so welcoming and helpful The room was clean the shower gel smell so good that we have to get one home Breakfast was great the bar has an amazing view and the design of the hotel itself is awesome We used to think of a hotel for just a place to stay but this hotel makes us wanting to stay as long as we could with a range of free movies and a comfy bed With the tube right at the doorstep you can reach anywhere in London or if you choose to explore the city by walking is not a bad idea at all We are definitely going to stay here again ,0,133,1
 We stayed at Casa Camper at the end of a 6 week trip From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel at home The lovely receptionist met us at the cab and helped us in even taking us to our room and offering to bring up tea with honey and we were a little unwell The facilities are excellent having the help yourself snack bar with delicious food was fantastic We loved our camper suite and thought it was well planned and the attention to detail amazing It felt like being at home and just what we needed I would recommend anyone staying there and we would again Thank you Casa Camper for making the last three days of our 6 1 2 week holiday so relaxed and enjoyable ,0,133,1
 This might be the best hotel we ve stayed in to date Really modern and clean and the location was great if you re okay with staying a bit out of the centre of London We didn t really need maid service and we were fine to reuse our towels so you just hang a sign on the door and you receive a 5 food voucher The front desk staff were friendly and efficient and helped us out when we wanted to stay another night We stayed on the second floor and it leads out onto a terrace where you will find the entrance to the DLR so really convenient The pool is awesome and also has a sauna steam and a gym Don t even hesitate just book this hotel ,0,133,1
 We stayed at Monument hotel for 3 nights for our romantic weekend gateway Staying at Monument Hotel was a fantastic experience for me and my husband The building has been recently renovated as hotel and the interior design is luxurious cosmopolitan and sylish The location is just perfect walking distance to La Pedrera metro stations shopping many nice restaurants Hotel staff was friendly proactive professional and courteous They accommodate to every request in a genuinely kind way We also had dinner at hotel s 3 Michelin star restaurant La Sarte It was a faboulus experience with wonderful food and amazing service We look forward to going back to Barcelona and staying again at Monument I believe the new roof top terrace and pool will be great additions to already wonderful hotel ,0,133,1
 We had an awesome experience at this hotel the room was very nice with modern furniture and a really big and comfy bed Everything was clean they changed the towels everyday and was happy to see that we even had a hair dryer in the bathroom The temperature was perfect in the room as the heating was turned on which was unexpected but a big plus for this considering that we went there in April The hotel it s really close to the metro station so 1 minute max of walking The breakfast was excellent you can chose from a variety of foods omelette cereals jam butter cheese yogurt salads fruits pastry and coffee of your own choice juices water All in all I would not hesitate to come back here ,0,133,1
 This was our second stay within a few days at this hotel see previous review This time we were in a Standard room which not surprisingly was a little smaller than an Executive room however the room was still big enough for our needs and not cramped We didn t notice much if any difference between the Standard and Executive rooms except for the space Nice modern clean hotel in a good location for transport and local amenities Staff were friendly and spoke good English which was useful as our German language skills failed us sometimes U3 line is about 5 minutes walk away and the Westbahnhof is a little further in the opposite direction from the U Bahn The area has many shops and restaurants nearby too on Mariahilfer Strasse ,0,133,1
 The front desk was extremely helpful and friendly going so far as to try to make reservations for me and my wife at nearby thermal baths in Baden bei Wien my German was not up to the task arranging airport transportation and being otherwise of assistance In particular the young man at the desk was extremely pleasant and helpful I believe his first name was Dominic The location on Webgasse is superb and with the U Bahn station entrance just a short distance up that street the Zieglergasse stop on Mariahilferstrasse the main shopping street unless you want to pay 1st District prices getting around in the city was effortless and quick This was about the 3rd or 4th year we have stayed here at Christmas and it has never disappointed ,0,133,1
 We loved our stay at hotel arena The hotel was great Staff was really kind especially for Job the guy encharged of the restaurant and Sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk Talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and I got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel That night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room It was a very classy detail We were so thankful about it Also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant Food is great Thank u for everything hotel arenaaa ,0,132,1
 We loved everything The staff were very friendly and welcoming the room was very clean and had lots of space though no drawers for clothes the bathroom was one of the nicest we ve ever been in with a great shower if a wee bit small a separate tub big fluffy towels The hotel provides a complimentary in house beer and water in the mini fridge which is replenished every day It s mid way between two tube stops Aldgate and Tower Hill so is convenient to everywhere There s lots of restaurants around so you don t have to eat in the hotel restaurant but the food there is really good the triple cooked chips were addicting It s our new go to hotel for future visits to London ,0,132,1
 Hotel was fresh clean very well laid out and the staff were fantastic Quite far out of town but very close to the tube so it was no bother at all and for the price we paid the travelling was more than worth it The local amenities had everything you could want too My only disappointment was the pillows they were practically non and didn t make for a good night s sleep at all but I kept forgetting to ask for firm replacements so it can t have bothered me that much I m sure the staff would have been more than happy to help had I raised it at the time All in all a fantastic wee place to stay I ll be back for sure Thank you ,0,132,1
 Loved everything about this Hotel All the staff we had met were friendly and always had a smile Location is great walking distance to everything and I mean all attractions Hotel itself is petite but I actually loved the contemporary feeling of it The room is a standard European size room which had double doors that overlooked other buildings courtyard Not the prettiest view but we didn t care we were in Paris The Bed was comfy and the room also had a spacious bathroom with lots of bench space The shower was a nice surprise it was huge And the best part was that the room had a complimentary Nespresso coffee machine We have one at home so it felt like home I will definitely be staying here again ,0,132,1

 This hotel is perfectly situated The area is quiet and lovely The view from my room was great I found the staff most helpful They went out of their way to accommodate any and all requests My only complaint would be with the bed The mattress wasn t all that comfortable as it dipped on one side I also found the duvet heavy and far to warm and had to request a regular blanket and sheet Other than that I would definitely stay here again Strongly recommend requesting a room in the front of the building I was originally booked into a back room over a very loud air conditioning system Sounded like a jet engine taking off every few minutes The staff were great about changing rooms for me ,0,132,1
 Staff were wonderful and were able to offer us directions maps and book tickets for us to make planning trips easier recommending bars restaurants and even printing boarding passes We were made to feel very welcome right from the start with arrival drinks at the bar Room was very clean and modern and the rooftop pool was perfect for relaxing in the sun after a day of exploring Excellent location out of the more touristy areas but also within easy walking distance of them and only a few blocks from the nearest Metro station Easy to get to all the big attractions whether by walking or by using the Metro We chose not to have breakfast at the hotel there are plenty of cafes nearby which offer a nice alternative ,0,132,1

 Super super good location Located in the middle of shopping area next to all kinds of shops like La perla rolex feels very safe walking around at night in this area for barcelona not far from good restaurants Really convenient Very nice room designs spacious comfortable and clean helpful staff great wifi Except one small thing that caused slight inconvenience the fridge in the room basically worked as a vending machine meaning you cannot open it but can only select what drinks you want from the screen and they come down so we bought some yogurt packs from the corner shop and couldnt store them in the fridge and had to finish them in the evening after dinner which was slightly annoying But otherwise this hotel was perfect for barcelona ,0,132,1

 Even though I had indicated on the booking that i was going to stay for one night this hotel charged me for two nights They assured me that this error was going to be sprted out The following morning When I was checking out the gentleman at Reception refused to sign me out and charge my card because according to him he was supposed to charge me for two nights I realised when I got home that I was charged double for one night To this day no one called me to rectify this or explain this to me I felt so violated and yes I will not recommend this hotel to anyone I know For them it s money before customer service Would not come back here again ,0,131,1
 We stayed for 2 nights for our honeymoon The hotel all staff the facilities the breakfast spa facilities were all of the highest standard possible It was beautiful The gentleman who checked us in on the afternoon of Monday 5th then took us up to our room and showed us the facilities our bags were fetched for us A cake was brought for us to celebrate our wedding by your considerate staff Nothing was too much trouble and this made our honeymoon Your staff were very attentive to its guests The room was brilliant the view over London fantastic especially from the bath The only downside I think is that due to the price we would be unable to afford very often BUT we would enjoy when we could ,0,131,1
 The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming We travelled with my elderly parents and requested rooms close together close to lifts and on lower floors and all 3 needs were met The staff couldn t do enough for you They are the real credit of the hotel The location is right in the thick of it between Piccadilly and Leicester Square and close to taxi ranks and tube The rooms are comfortable and quite spacious for central London and clean Coffee machines in the rooms and the complimentary fridge is a fantastic idea really appreciated that touch Breakfast was great plenty of it and delicious and catered for all Overall couldn t fault it It was quite expensive but worth it for the comfort location and the excellent staff ,0,131,1
 Although the rooms are on the small side they are perfectly formed The bed was huge and very comfortable I loved using the IPad to control everything in the room lighting TV Temperature etc We had a room overlooking the Tower of London which was really special The location is perfect and the hotel is right on top of the tube so you don t have to go far at all to jump on the train The communal areas of the hotel are very cool and very relaxing Unfortunately after coming back to the hotel from our night out we just missed out on going out onto the veranda for a drink however the indoor bar area still has fantastic views over the city I would stay here again ,0,131,1
 I liked everything about the hotel but the sofa beds werent so comfy and we didnt have an iron in the room although on the website it says all rooms have and iron and ironing table When you ask the room service people to bring something up you meed to ask twice or three times Reception staff would ask for deposit but when you check out they wont give the deposit nack until you ask them She also didnt want to return the deposit because she said you had breakfast with 5 person but i didnt She was thinking for another excuse and she said again oh ya you had breakfast more than a limit But nowhere on the hotel webside mention that there is a limit for breakfast ,0,131,1
 The hotel opened one months before we arrived With that everything is new and shiny The Spa and Fitness area is amazing and included in the room price Hamam Sauna Fitness room and swimming pool are free of charge The internet connection was great no issues with that I can t say anything about the breakfast as we decided to eat outside The location is very central Eiffel tower is 25 mins walking distance The catacombs as well For the lazy people Uber is quite cheap and easy to get within Paris The staff is very helpful and friendly They could answer all questions about the location and how to get somewhere I would totally recommend this place and when going to Paris again I will stay there again ,0,131,1
 Well I was not sure how to rate this place as there is one big issue they also have rooms in the basement with fake windows that look out on the hall for the same price as the rooms on the standard floors This is a real disgrace to offer basement rooms for over a hundred pounds For such room I wouldn t rate them more than 6 7 But after my complain they moved me to the room on the second floor so I must rate them based on what I had and the room was very nice everything new modern style clean and with nice small kitchenette Also the area around this hotel is pretty nice and in walking distance from metro station and beautiful Holland Park ,0,131,1
 Amazing location is only the first impressive thing about this hotel Next is the welcoming and genuinely carting staff who withsmile on their faces will assist you from the moment you book your stay until your last minute in Barcelona The rooms are spacious decorated with taste and elegance with all of the high end amenities The view from the balcony and terrace is amazing and if you choose the studio with your private pool you have your own lounging area outside with a chance for a cool off To top it all off there is a great restaurant downstairs with competitive prices and a menu with all the local options The food is tasty and delivered with flair and by pleasant and accommodating wait staff Definitely worth recommending ,0,131,1
 The location is great you catch a free ferry over to the city centre which only takes 10mintues also very easy to get to and from the airport by train which only cost 10 for two people each way The hotel from the outside isn t the best looking but inside definitely makes up for it The room was luxurious with a comfort bed a lovely view cosy dressing gowns spacious walk in shower large flat screen TV coffee tea making facilities and electronic system to request clean up service or do not disturb also one to control lights The staff were very helpful and polite the cookies we got given was a nice touch 100 the hotel is worth the money the stay was excellent would definitely recommend ,0,131,1
 We stayed at Ink prior to a Viking Christmas Markets cruise It was wonderful centrally located to everything we wanted to visit lovely restaurant bar where we enjoyed a great breakfast each morning along with some of the best coffee we ve ever had and finished the day with a cocktail or two before turning in for the evening Our room was spotlessly clean with a super comfortable bed And the staff were incomparably professional friendly and helpful They intervened in our frantic efforts to locate our delayed luggage contacting local airline representatives to get immediate answers about when we could expect delivery Through their help we received our luggage before we had to depart on our cruise This hotel does indeed deserve an exceptional rating across the board ,0,131,1

 Interesting hotel with a history of it having being a wealthy occupancy over the past decades The lovely unaltered appearance of Victorian era as approaching the entrance and within to the reception area door staff to welcome you in politely and with its own mini private theatre now a small busy and comfortable bar but retaining the unchanged decor of that period We had a small bedroom but clean and as we were only sleeping it was adequate Staff were very polite helpful and as we observed very patient Good position with tube station very close Queensway Hyde Park opposite which is always a lovely walk through for Landmarks ie Kensington Palace Serpentine Diana memorial water feature Nearby restaurants with many tastes catered for Good choice in London ,0,130,1
 I requested a quiet room as I was exhausted from travel and it was truly a quiet room It was a loft room on the third floor which is only accessible via a flight of stairs from the second floor with no other rooms next to me and no traffic in the hallway in front of the room Restaurant was very nice as well and late night room service was available for light snacks and sandwiches perfect after my flight delays They also offer a nice high tea Staff was always helpful and courteous no matter the hour The hotel is about a 7 minute walk from the underground which took me to central London in about 20 minutes Neighborhood is quiet mostly residential with some shops nearby ,0,130,1
 Staff were fantastic could not do enough for you I loved the little touches here and there such as after booking in getting ready and then going back out I came back to the room late to find my bed prepared for me to get into it water next to the bed new towels slippers placed next to the bed lovely music on and the lights set on a lovely dim setting could not believe it even when booking a taxi the gentlemen at the door went down the road just to flag one down for me I have been to many of a 5 star hotels but this particular one topped them all Quality of service was amazing breakfast lovely will definitely be using again very soon ,0,130,1
 The entire experience was phenomenal From the moment you realize that the entire room can be controlled with an ipad TV Movies Radio Lights Curtains Blinds Mood Lighting to the awesome fact that everything in the mini fridge is yours Totally free Also totally free is the wifi not crappy slow free wifi but fast always connected seamless wifi all the time Free But by far the best feature is the staff Helpful funny supportive You will be in the company of friends I never heard a No they always tried to find a way to help If we asked for something each shift would inform the next shift what needs to be done until they resolved our need The future of modern technically advanced client centric Hotels ,0,130,1
 We stayed one night and on arrival were upgraded to an apartment which was a nice touch and very much appreciated We went to the TOZI Italian restaurant downstairs and the food was excellent They do an Italian version of tapas style and you order multiple smaller portions We had 5 small dishes between both of us and I really enjoyed the experience as I never had eaten this style before Room was air conditioned and this worked well Breakfast was in the TOZI restaurant area and all food was freshly prepared freshly squeezed orange juice was a nice touch Add to all of this the convenience of being very close to Victoria tube station and we will definitely stay here the next time we are in London ,0,130,1
 we stayed at the hotel from the 20th 23rd of august and enjoyed our stay and the staff were great when we checked out we left a bag behind in the room and only realised we didn t have it when we got to the airport and all the kids presents and our families gifts were in it and one of the night staff called akmid not sure of the spelling called a taxi and sent our bag to the airport so the kids wouldn t go without their presents and he also put 11 pounds of his own money to pay towards the taxi fare as we didn t have enough so a huge thank you to him and the kids were very happy with their presents ,0,130,1
 The room was AMAZING The staff was great The first person you meet is the door person and a smile immediately puts the nervous tourist in you at ease Excellent location If you miss breakfast there are some great little places nearby to get a coffee and croissant take away Walking distance to Pret if you re really hungry Hyde Park is a stones throw away Nice quiet and very nice location Paddington Station is also a short walk and it s not as bustling and intense as St Pancras This hotel was perfect my first night in London as I was exhausted and jet lagged It was cold and rainy so I stayed put in the room and enjoyed the one night I stayed to the max ,0,130,1

 The Hotel Michelangelo in Milan is a high rise across the street from the train station and very convenient from that viewpoint which is why I stayed there based on a local recommendation I quite enjoyed my stay from a cultural viewpoint The hotel is modern in an Italian modern from forty or fifty years ago sense Everything in the room is a gadget to figure out including a pants press The wi fi only works when the TV is turned on the instructions were good The curtains open and shut with electronic button controls Sort of a James Bond hotel in a word Try it you might like it or at least the challenge of some the puzzles as to how to work things like the shower ,0,130,1
 Have been to London many many times and been to many hotels I honestly am in love with this one The whole experience from the entrance and the greeting to the friendly and welcoming receptionist clean and cozy room and a very nice bar The rooms were quiet with a nice view Coming from Switzerland I always have a problem with the charger but not this time they had usb ports on the wall The position of the hotel is just above Oxford Circus which is good for those who want to go shopping or visit attractions or just go around The lobby is also amazing I will be using this hotel for my future visits to London I finally found the perfect location and service in London ,0,130,1
 It was a very pleasant stay here The room we got was very clean and modern We had a little balcony 5th floor which was very nice You can darken the room very well The bathroom was spacious very rare for Paris The elevator though was very very small but I think this is rather a detail The staff was very helpfull and friendly You can leave your luggage in the hotel as you checkout and you still want to discover Paris We didn t took the breakfast at the hotel The hotel is located in a very good neighbourhood of Paris The distance to the nearest metrostation is not close but nor far either You have a little supermarket in the neighbourhood This hotel is recommended ,0,129,1
 The first time we stayed here after I proposed to my wife and she absolutely loved the place this time we returned and will definitely do so again in the future L hotel is the best hotel in Paris if you like luxurious but small boutique hotels and personal service It has a very cosy bar area with a good selection of special cocktails for a nice aperitif and the restaurant setting is beautiful We did not have dinner here however only breakfast which I highly recommend Don t forget to reserve the complimentary 1 hour private hamam very nice to do when you arrive at the hotel or just before after dinner One of the best hotels I ve stayed in and we will definitely return ,0,129,1
 This was my first time coming to this hotel and I must say it is fantastic when I was coming in to check in there was a queue but the staff apologies and gave as a glass of champagne I didn t have to wait long and the check in was very fast When I saw my room I was very happy with everything look good and the bed was so Comfortable unfortunately I didn t go to the spa so I couldn t experience how it was Overall this hotel is beautiful and amazing and I will definitely come back here with my panther and try out the spa and thank you and your staff for Making us feel welcome I had the best weekend ever ,0,129,1
 A very warm welcome and the staff were great in showing us to the room and attending to our luggage When checking in we were asked if it was a trip for any special reason it was my wife s birthday the day we checked in and our wedding anniversary the day we checked out On returning to our room in the evening of our arrival we were delighted to find a Birthday card with special chocolates on a slate with Happy Birthday written in icing sugar and a bottle of Bubbly on ice A most thoughtful gesture Even the fire alarm going off on Sunday morning and the evacuation of the hotel was carried out calmly and with great speed and courtesy by all the staff ,0,129,1
 The hotel is located within a walking distance from Victoria station It also takes 15 20 min by public transport to get almost anywhere in the city centre The district is charming lots of small restaurants around no problem with that The hotel itself is cosy rooms are small but clean and nice The self service breakfast is very fair Apart from it you may have a full English breakfast a porridge or a good granola for 5 extra pounds The only drawback is probably the long narrow staircase if you stay on the top floor there s no lift That apart the hotel provides good value for money I would definitely choose it again if I need a place in the centre for 2 3 days ,0,129,1
 This Hotel is excellent Having booked a mid range room at a discounted rate we were advised on arrived that we have been upgraded free if charge to an executive room which was fabulous This is the first time I have come across a room with a TV in the bath complete luxury for less than 100 per night The staff at the St George could not do enough to make us welcome and the continental breakfast included was plentiful and delicious Thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone attending events at Wembley Stadium or Wembley Arena Staying here is a great way to round off a trip to Wembley Thank you so much to everyone at the St George we hope to see you all very soon ,0,129,1

 This hotel is ideal for visitors to the Excel Arena It is situated at the western door and down a flight of steps The rooms are modern and comfortable the breakfast is good and the staff are friendly and helpful I walked to and from London City Airport to the hotel in about twenty minutes each way There is a footbridge alongside the hotel and then a pleasant walk past Barrier Park worth a visit if you have time There is a local shop across the way and a small Tesco nearby great for a few things and a small bottle of wine for an evening meal I was busy and didn t know when I would get to eat All in all a good hotel choice ,0,129,1

 I absolutely loved the location and I appreciated the small boutique size of this hotel It was spotlessly clean and beautifully appointed with white and gold trim We both found our room to be extremely quiet as we could never hear people coming or going in the hallways The staff was friendly and helpful and always greeted us with a wave or a cheery hola whenever we left or returned We would happily recommend this hotel to others and would consider returning ourselves if we go to Barcelona again It was close to absolutely everything we wanted to do and so handy to every type of transportation including the Hop On Hop Off Bus the Julia Tours office as well as the subway and the bus system ,0,129,1
 The hotel is well located within easy walking distance of the main city centre On arrival the staff were welcoming and we got our favourite room with a city view Cocktails in the Sky Bar are a must with Rene the friendly mixologist The rooms are spacious bed comfortable with a large bath and shower area with Hermes products The icing on the cake was the nice touch on departure when our car was brought up by the valet with complimentary water bottles sweets and a hand written note wishing us a speedy return This is not our first stay here over the years and it is refreshing to see that the standards have been maintained Finally the concierge provided us with good advice for our stay ,0,129,1

 I booked the trip as it was my boyfriends 30th birthday I booked a standard room but emailed the hotel to ask if they could do something special with it explained it was my boyfriends 30th I just thought we d get a complimentary bottle of wine or something along those lines When we arrived the hotel had upgraded our room free of charge to a superior room which had a small balcony with an amazing view the room was perfect the bed was extremely comfy Also when we arrived back to the hotel room later that night we had a bottle of wine a plate of goodies waiting for us to with a card wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday It was excellent Would definitely recommend ,0,129,1
 The bedroom was very well equipped with a lovely Nespresso machine and replenishing the capsules was not a problem plus complimentary bottles of water The breakfast was fabulous quality with lots of choice and when we asked if there were any more chocolate muffins the waitress brought a fresh batch one for each of us to our table The staff at check in were extremely helpful and when we requested a fan for one of the rooms found one immediately The cookies on check in were delicious and we were even given some more on check out A really positive experience all round We had champagne afternoon tea in the Urban Meadow and that was also excellent quality and the staff in the restaurant were terrific ,0,128,1
 This hotel is absolutely lovely It is in a great location and was very clean and comfortable The room was very well designed tasteful decor and plenty of room for our things It felt very spacious We had everything we needed The windows opened onto a lovely quiet courtyard The hotel itself is quite small and we liked the cosy boutique feel The staff were lovely really friendly We simply adored it We didn t get around to having breakfast in the hotel but probably should have As we felt a bit ripped off by the cafe directly across the road Highly recommend this lovely hotel and would go back in a heartbeat Thank you for a wonderful and memorable stay for all the right reasons ,0,128,1
 I had booked an executive room but was placed in a premium room I had a 9 day stay and at day 3 I asked if I was in an executive room I was not in an executive room They comped me breakfast for the remainder of my stay I was pleased They knew I was not getting the amenities of an executive room and would fix it Twenty four hours later I was still not getting the extra amenities Talked to guest services again They offered to move me to another room they provided the amenities I had been missing and they sent me wine and chocolates as a means to make things right I liked that they wanted me to be a satisfied guest ,0,128,1
 I love the hotel decor Staying in London I wanted to stay in a hotel that had the antique style and feel to it and this hotel does was perfect for that It is in a beautiful suburb with little local shops near by and a 1 min walk to the Warwick Street tube station So after sightseeing all day you just get of the tube and you are at the hotel The best thing of all was the phone they provide in all the rooms You can make local calls book tickets and tours etc and best of all use google maps to get around We never got lost once It was free and we took it everywhere with us Overall really liked the hotel ,0,128,1

 Excellent location a few minutes walk from Angel Underground The hotel is set back from the Main Street so it is very quiet but with a huge choice of restaurants and bars virtually on the doorstep We had a fantastic view of the city skyline from our room Upon arrival only one of the rooms was ready and after heading out for a walk and returning at 5pm it still wasn t ready The receptionist gave us access to the executive lounge so we could wait there and extended the access for the whole of our stay Even though we didn t have a chance to use the lounge again it was a very nice gesture and immediately turned an unhappy client into a happy one ,0,128,1
 The bed was very comfortable The room was a nice size tastefully decorated in a modern french country design Amazing support beams artfully refinished throughout the whole structure Is both comfortable and artsy The staff are exceedingly helpful and friendly they take the time out for you to make reservations help you find facilities and anything else your heart desires The location is amazing You just walk out the door and there are amazing restaurants wonderful boutiques small grocery fresh fruit markets pharmacy and anything else that you might want An 8 minute walk to the front of Notre Dame Cathedral Staying on Ile St Louis was very pleasant experience and this hotel is outstanding I will stay at this hotel my next trip to Paris ,0,128,1
 Had never stayed at a Citizen M hotel before and though very contemporary and certainly different to Hilton it was nonetheless very refreshing with a good outdoor space to watch the world and drink wine or coffee The best thing about the hotel was the staff extremely friendly and helpful and plentiful Such nice people Also our room despite being opposite the lift always a worry was ultra quiet We never heard anyone above or next door so superior was the sound proofing I know the room is full of the huge bed but my gosh it was comfy One of the best hotel beds I have slept on Possibly not for everyone but we loved it and we wil definitely stay again A converted Citizen ,0,128,1
 After traveling around Europe Paris is our last stop We re already tired when we arrived at the Hotel but the 2 gentleman at the reception greeted us warmly and cheerfully They are very helpful professional Also I emailed the hotel about clothes iron if they have a month ago and when we arrived at the room it s already there The rooms are always clean and this one is very important for me It smells nice when we arrive and the bed is comfortable Biotherm toiletries are also provided so you don t have to bring your own if you re picky The breakfast was awesome and they have an open bar all day Location is perfect around 5 mins walking distance to the Louvre ,0,128,1
 We arrived late at night due to delays on the railway and were upgraded to a very fine suite at no extra cost Although several reviews commented on street noise we on the 6th floor did not notice any rather we found it blissfully quiet Staff were attentive without being officious and everything was spotlessly clean The courtesy umbrella proved very useful thank you when my wife had her own but I had none The location suited us down to the ground short walk to British Museum and Covent Garden easy transport to the South Bank Unusually for the UK the plumbing worked with proper hot water coming from the proper shower and all drains working properly We could have stayed longer and will come again ,0,128,1
 Welcomed with a warm chocolate cookie the experience was top class I had a great time at this hotel and visited lots locally with lots of history surrounding this property it s in the prime location for exploring The staff at the hotel were willing to assist and always on hand I requested extra pillows and they were in my room in a flash I couldn t have been happier with this property and would rate it highly in all aspects when I checked out they were even then still more than happy to hold my luggage whilst I explored my last day in the city when I returned to collect my luggage there was no problem at all everybody was smiling and happy to assist ,0,128,1
 Wow I travel to the greater London area and London City since 1998 rather frequently Over the years I got used to many run down hotels and staff that could not really care any less This was my first time at this hotel It was more of an accident that I placed reservations here I was most pleasantly surprised Very kind staff at reception and throughout the entire hotel the bath was the most modern and clean bathroom I have seen in London in ages A shower with a water pressure that was surprise not suppressed to a narrow stream This DoubleTree is worth any extra travel time before I sacrifice on service and comfort again and stay at a different hotel I ll be back ,0,128,1
 We arrived earlier than the check in time but were given a room at once which was a help The room was nicely furnished and clean with a comfortable bed The breakfast was excellent with everything you could want everything regularly replenished so no hanging around for foods that had run out and the cakes bread and pastries were very fresh Excellent scrambled eggs The waiting staff were helpful and attentive We found all the hotel staff restaurant bar and reception to be very friendly and helpful A special mention to Andreas on reception who was utterly charming friendly and efficient The hotel had a very pleasant atmosphere which was down to the staff and probably because the guests didn t have anything to complain about ,0,128,1
 Staff are very friendly and nice especially the lady at the breakfast reception welcoming us on Tuesday 12 07 Friday 15 07 and the cleaning lady of our room 504 during our stay These 2 persons are really Excellent and I would like to thank them Especially the cleaning lady of room 504 I appreciate alot for her small gesture of thoughtful way of arranging things such as let the dishwashing sponge dry which I used to wash milk bottles everyday I put a small box of chocolate at the reception for her when we checked out Hope she got it Our room 504 was big enough to put a baby cot next to our bed It was spacious Overall we had an excellent stay there ,0,128,1
 We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Am Parkring Some highlights Beautiful view from the room and the balcony Quiet no noise from street below or surroundings Park across the street Quickest check out ever Close til airport train station shopping restaurants bars Good bed nice firm mattress Restaurant Das Schick is excellent we went for dinner on a Saturday night did not have breakfast at the hotel georgeous food drinks and wine excellent service high standards view The hotel actually mean what they say about changing of towels policy It bothers me when hotels claim to be environmental considerate but still changes towels etc when there is no need to and we haven t asked them to haven t placed the towels on the floor ,0,128,1
 The hotel is just about perfect in my opinion Walking distance to Las Ramblas Train Stations and all the attractions but off the beaten path enough for you to enjoy a good night s sleep when you are in town The rooms are very comfortable and the wi fi is speedy as well as reliable There is a large comfortable bed and the staff is extremely accommodating The breakfast is also very good it was on special for 10 euros when I was there and worth it But all around there are great places to go Also don t miss the restaurant across the street It s outstanding Overall I couldn t be happier with this hotel and can t imagine staying anywhere else in Barcelona ,0,128,1
 Wonderful hotel friendly staff great location The roof top terrace which had views of Sagrada Famillia was just a beautiful place to relax at anytime of the day or night The buffet breakfast offered plenty of variety The additional option to order hot food from the kitchen for no extra cost was an added bonus The location of the hotel is super just a minute from Sagrada Famillia hop on hop off bus and the metro Gaudi s Avenue is less than 5 mins walk away There are plenty of good quality resutrants within a short distance of the hotel offering a range of different cusines too The hotel staff were very good at recommending good places to eat within a short distance of the hotel ,0,128,1
 I booked the Crowne Plaza as we were seeing Coldplay at Wembley Stadium The location wasn t the best but the whole area isn t great Saying that it only cost 10 in an Uber each way to the Stadium so we were happy with that Our room was perfect and the bed so comfy I d put in a special request as it was my fianc s birthday and we had a bottle of complimentary wine in our room with a card which was lovely Breakfast was great Staff really friendly Apologising if you wait more than a minute Room service was good too They had late night options on especially for the concert Would definitely stay again if we were going to the stadium ,0,128,1
 This is not my first time at Intercontinental le Grand and it sure won t be the last This hotel is extremely well located in Paris next to Auber station on RER A 3 min walk from Lafayette Galeries The breakfast at Caf de La Paix is very pleasant and varied The staff is helpful and very well trained It feels like a 5 stars hotel Even the classic room that is a bit small is very clean and comfortable and is very suitable for one person At the end of your trip you wonder who is directing this successful hotel well his name is Mr Christophe Laure and i guess he is an excellent CEO I hope he will keep on the good job ,0,127,1
 We moved the stuff from the fridge to put are own stuff in it and it was motion censored so they then wanted to charge us for everything in the fridge They locked the fridge and we had to ask them to unlock it so we could take are own items out We had already asked them to remove all items and they still tried to charge us for the whole mini bar and they had already taken it all away we had to then wait in a long line for a refund Unfortunately we also had a very noisy room opposite the railway Having stayed in 4 5 star hotels I feel this was not anywhere close we will not be returning Very disappointed ,0,127,1
 I think this is the first time when we booked a room on this website and the photos of the hotel are exactly what the hotel looks like in real life We ve booked club room and got a free upgrade to one of their suites The room was very clean and spacious and the beds were comfy There was a TV in the bathroom and a walk in shower We enjoyed our stay so much Staff were all friendly and helpful The check out was at 11am however when we called reception asking for later check out we ve been told we can stay till 12 30 free of charge which absolutely made our day Thank you so much We will definitely be back ,0,127,1
 The hotel is situated in a side street seconds away from a tube station and the tower of london On arrival we were welcomed with a warm cookie which is a lovely touch after the stresses of travelling in london The room was clean and well equipped with modern styling A huge bonus for us was the sky lounge rooftop bar Outstanding views of the city with delicious cocktails and a good range of foods available The breakfast is buffet style with a huge range of foods on offer all exceptional quality and delicious initially on booking we did think the additional cost for breakfast was steep We would now urge you to pay the extra Range includes continental full english pancakes muffins and waffles ,0,127,1
 The room had a good opening window sounds odd but some places you either can t open the window or when you do its hardly worth it It was a warm weekend and we were glad of the breeze there was aircon but we prefer the fresh air The bed was extremely comfy and the toiletries were Noble Isle very posh and indulgent The Hotel was highly decorated which was delightful and there was an ipad which allowed full interaction should you need it We stayed here for the proximity to the Museums specifically for the V A which is only 5 mins walk away The area has plenty of chain eateries as well as individual restaurants we ate out for all of our meals ,0,127,1
 I am not the person that likes to write a review but before booking I always do read This time I had to say something about my stay in Olivia Balmes hotel First of all thanks to all stuff in hotel Very kind and always at your disposal for any request at any time Location perfect for sightseeing in center of Barcelona Breakfast very good with variety of food Rooms modern with new furniture and lot of space for all clothes no need to keep some in luggage Great value for money you pay Taxi station just across the hotel Playa de Catalyna and Rambla street just couple min walk distance To summarize my impression it is perfect for tourists and businesses trips to Barcelona ,0,127,1
 The best hotel I have ever been to The bed was really comfortable and the clearness was excellent Java Cleaner did a great job The gym has a hotel with basic but good equipment to work out every morning at not extra cost The location on my opinion was brilliant it was not that close to the main attractions but it was really good communicated in terms of transport the tram stop was less than 2 minutes away from the hotel and you can also buy any travel card bus tram from the hotel and within 10 15 minutes you will be in the Iamsterdan sign and museums In addition the check in and check outs are done really quick To conclude I highly recommend it,0,127,1
 This was an ideal location for our family on a short break to Amsterdam just a short train ride from the airport early check in as we had executive rooms very helpful staff on Reception who gave great advice and so close to the 4 tram to get in and out of the centre Breakfast was great with long serving time and lots of choice Really can t fault the service or hotel all staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful Obviously it s quiet at night as there s nothing to do in the area and no nice views as in the business district but the service hotel and ease of travel more than makes up for this Highly recommend this hotel ,0,127,1
 From the moment we arrived late and after a long day we were greeted with a smile and outstanding helpfulness The room was outstanding chic and fabulous quality conditioning works really well and is individually controlled Two things that can sometimes be difficult to find in London Bed super comfy Bathroom top class The food at the restaurant is wonderful only exceeded by the service This hotel is exceptionally quiet yet incredibly handy to Tower Hill tube It was my sister s birthday and I had made a comment in the reservation A lovely card and chocolates were in the room and then the next day a divine plate of deserts arrived for us with a happy birthday message for her Truly an impressive hotel ,0,127,1

 great location from the train station as we were leaving via train the next morning despite prior information found this location quite safe greeted warmly by porter as soon as we entered the hotel room small but pristine wonderful array of breakfast food wonderful only negative was policy re getting an iron and ironing board we were told we had to return same within an hour of use found this strange but understand that we are not in the US when hotels usualay provide this in the rooms overall a great stay after an overnight from the us porter even offered to take our luggage to the train station the next morning 5 out of 5 rating would stronglyou recommend this hotel to felow travelers ,0,127,1
 An absolutely incredible boutique hotel offering so much value for money at the top end of the hotel market You could pay 4 times more for a room at one of the more established 5 hotel chains in Paris and yes you d have a bigger lobby and some extra facilities you d never use but at Le Narcisse they ve really focussed on the things that matter Excellent service beautifully designed rooms a top end spa and they ve invested in really high quality fixtures and fittings To top it all the restaurant provides exquisite fine dining without a silly price tag to go with it and again the service was faultless Whoever runs this place should be proud I ll be back ,0,126,1
 Great location in Greenwich Room wasn t large but was clean and comfortable Shower worked well Asked for a quieter room got one towards the back Still a bit of road noise but that was to be expected since its right on one of the busy streets in Greenwich Was there in mid June with nice temperatures so had window open Put some ear plugs in and slept fine Probably would be quieter in winter Great view of St Alfage s church next door There is a lift for those who don t want to take the stairs Breakfast was decent Nice breakfast room in the back of the pub Within easy walking distance of sights in Greenwich A few blocks from tube stop ,0,126,1

 I stayed here in December with a group of friends and we all agreed it was a great choice It is located at the Central Train Station and is within easy walking distance of sights and nightlife The staff were very helpful for those unsure of directions or places of interest and had plenty of suggestions for food and entertainment without just trying to get us to only spend money in the hotel There seemed to be two staff members in the door for this The rooms were comfortable clean and well appointed as were the bathrooms with quality toiletries Dinner was very good if a bit expensive All in all a great stay here Would definitely return and also highly recommend to others ,0,126,1
 I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the room the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and all that for a comparably lower price especially considering the location I ve stayed in Swissotel in Zurich earlier this year where I d give the opposite rating for most of the questions above I only needed a temporary place to stay as I live in Amsterdam For this reason I wanted something close to the office I work at willing to sacrifice the quality for location Surprisingly I got one of the best quality rooms I ve stayed in while it was still dirt cheap Check my rating history here I don t usually provide feedback only if it was very bad or exceptionally good ,0,126,1
 If you are looking for old world charm combined with the highest standards of customer care this is the place for you From the moment of arrival the professional staff are attentive and ready to respond to requests in an efficient and timely manner The room we had was spacious comfortably furnished and immaculately clean Barcelona has much to offer but for time spent in the hotel there is also much to enjoy from stunning roof garden offering panoramic views and swimming pool intimate cocktail bar first rate spa and intriguing breakfast room We ate in the on premise one Michelin star Caelis Restaurant and the roof garden and enjoyed the very different cuisine equally Certainly a hotel I will return to Medya Shakarchi ,0,126,1

 Comfortable bed Good breakfast You may park your car free of charge on the street I was lucky and parked my car just at the hotel entrance Interesting artistic design of the hotel each level is different like mural s festival A library at the lobby with many art books I asked for a room with shower not a bathtub and it was large and comfortable Good access by car located outside center And good access to public transport Metro about 10 minutes of slow walk tram about 6 minutes and bus 2 to 10 minutes depending on the line Most of tourist places in the range of 30 50 minutes by public transport door to door including walking to from tram metro bus ,0,126,1

 I must have reviewed this place about 6 times at least as we stay there every year it almost feels like a home from home not sure I have much new to add Off the train over the road check in drinks on the terrace within 20 minutes of arriving in the city The staff are lovely The rooms are fantastic The beds are comfortable You get a brilliant panoramic view of the city from the terrace bar and usually a decent view from your room balcony too We even had an actual bathtub this year I don t know if all the rooms have one but I m sure they ll sort you if you ask Same time next year then Of course ,0,126,1

 Don t miss staying here Superior service and staff The hotel is beautiful it was a small palace and those details are evident downstairs The rooms have been completely redone recently and resemble the simplicity of the 4 Seasons Breakfast selection was excellent with eggs made to order After a long trip from San Francisco and a five hour delay I was greeted with champagne and an upgraded room since they could not get me into a room before 2 PM that afternoon This hotel would be a wonderful 5 day base from which to explore Barcelona It s in near the historic district with a harbor view so you have everything close by Thank you staff for a wonderful but too short stay ,0,126,1
 The room was nice and big with facility to the pool The staff was friendly and helpful to us while staying Although we had some problems with the credit card which we had to talk to several people through the main line for the hotels before we were transfer to someone in the actual hotel to help us The beds were ok but could had been more comfortable for a five star hotel The rooms need to be remodeled as well Because of this and the price being expensive I did not feel it was not a good value Although if the issues were addressed then I would say it was excellent The staff was very helpful in getting cabs and holding our luggage ,0,126,1
 When we arrived we were upgraded with the room one level up and got junior suite for free Room was nice and very moder with smart remote control of main process light blind tv etc if like such style you will be satisfied Our daughter was excited about that But in any case unfortunately room was little bit too small and I hit my foot finger by furniture twice on the way from bathroom Bathroom itself was amazing and show example of functionality and Disign Bar on L flore very nice and we spend nice evening time there Location is great and I could say most convenient if you would like to visit all the shops Our stay was good as usual in Milano ,0,126,1

 The coolest apartment ever We stayed in the playroom and it has everything you can wish for a dancing pole a sourrond system bar a huge lounge two bathrooms comfy and huge beds The apartment itself was huge too and it felt like your own night club Absolutely perfect for young people And it was really easy and fast to get into the city center as the metro is just outside the hotel We definitely recommend the playroom apartment to everyone You won t be disappointed Also the staff are young friendly and amazing and the hotel has its own restaurant and a modern gym you can use for free And it s a big supermarket just across the road if you need something ,0,126,1
 The hotel reception is beautiful On arrival we were welcomed with Prosecco and freshly baked muffins and a fruit platter Tonic and Remedy is a wonderful bar with delicious food The room is absolutely exquisite and spacious with high tech features and awesome light settings This is the type of hotel you don t want to leave The staff were always greeting and were more than happy to help out This hotel is conveniently located next to Old Street Station and is a 15 minute walk from the vibrant bars and restaurants of shoreditch There were a few great little restaurants within a 5 minute walk I will be back to this exceptional hotel Do yourself a favour and indulge in this gem ,0,125,1
 Upon arrival the staff were lovely very informative and friendly I absolutely loved the style of the hotel it was so retro and quirky it didn t have that uptight stuff feel to a normal hotel I ve never stayed in a hotel like it The little touches in the room just made it all the better the retro radio the milk and free water in the fridge nice to not have the pastursied milk When we came back after our night there was a DJ and it was so busy felt like a bar than a hotel Although once in Our room it felt like our own little home Staff were fantastic and was such a chilled atmosphere couldn t fault it ,0,125,1
 The room was small but clean and comfortable The staff were very helpful Unfortunately I had a number of problems with the room The television did not work apparently the cleaners had knocked the cables out the phone was broken and needed replacing and the safe would not open All of these issues were resolved but led to a rather stressful evening when I was getting ready to go out I felt all of these issues should have been checked and resolved before the room was declared ready for use The worse problem was the overpowering smell of drains sewage from the bathroom The housekeeper came and used an air freshener which only helped for a few minutes Overall a rather disappointing experience ,0,125,1
 Amazing location I loved the fact it way quiet and I fell in love with the design and the location of the hotel You get a pass for the water ferry which took us over the river Nice little perk Although the hotel itself was a bit of a labyrinth our room was a decent size and had a very pleasant deco Pretty quiet Only down was that we couldn t access our balcony would ve been nice to sit out w a drink however when mentioned at check out staff very helpfully mentioned to ask on next booking you d like a balcony Breakfast amazing restaurant very nice beautiful sitting outside by the river Loved it Will be defo back w the family,0,125,1
 Marble Arch by Montcalm boutique hotel is a gem of a hotel situated about 100 meters or so from the Marble Arch entrance to Hyde Park and equally close to the Marble Arch tube station It is within easy walking distance to the famous Oxford and Baker Street and a short uber hop to all of the more famous landmarks of London We stayed at the Marble Arch London for just over a week and were extremely happy with the hotel from the check in we were upgraded at no extra cost to the breakfasts to the overall friendliness of the staff The rooms were more than adequate considering this is London and space is a premium we were not cramped at all ,0,125,1
 The king size room was clean and tidy and the en suite was a nice size however we didn t like the shower and set up of the bathroom because there was a drain in the middle of the bathroom and when in the shower due to the size and where the shower was the water went everywhere and everywhere was left wet once you had showered Needs a short screen or curtain to stop this from happening The bed wasn t the most comfortable and the walls are thin to the point I could hear the man upstairs conversation when he woke me up at 4am The staff were lovely and friendly and did all they could to make the stay enjoyable ,0,125,1
 I just have to commend Emanuelle and Isabelle They went ABOVE AND BETOND to assist me and my son We were delayed by train from Lyxembourg which would have prevented us from picking up our Paris Pass documents Even though short staffed they went to the facility that distributes these passes and pick them up for us so we would be able to enjoy Paris and not waste our investment I run Customer Experience for my company Alriaource and I can honestly say that these two employees are two of the best service individuals o have ever encountered I would hire them in a heartbeat It is my hope that they are aptly rewarded and recognized for providing exemplary service Thank you Regards Jennifer,0,125,1
 The free glass of bubbly on arrival got our stay off to a great start It was my wife s birthday on the day after we arrived and the hotel had upgraded us to a room with a four poster bed which they had decorated with a birthday message made of rose petals The birthday cake chocolates and balloons also made this a really memorable stay The hotel is wonderfully situated in the heart of theatreland within two minute walking access to Piccadilly Circus Soho Chinatown Regent Street and Leicester Square Although the Piccadilly is on busy Shaftesbury Avenue noise from the street wasn t a major issue For a city centre break this hotel s hospitality and location is hard to beat ,0,125,1
 We stayed at the Hotel Colon in mid July and found the location to be wonderful Barcelona is a large city but this hotel was a perfect location for almost anything You walk out of the hotel and you are in front of the Cathedral We had a a room with a little balcony that looked out over the square and Cathedral which was just perfect The room itself was charming and clean The food in Barcelona is amazing If you need to catch a taxi they are right down the street but again location is great if you re willing to walk and explore Staff was very helpful and friendly Would recommend to anyone who wants to experience the charms of Barcelona ,0,125,1
 The room is very comfortable spacious and the bathroom is very clean There s onsite parking and it s just right next to petrol kiosk so it s very convenient to just walk out to buy snacks and food from the kiosk if you need You can also top up petrol just before you leave for your trips or to the airport It s a slight distance from the airport compared to another hotel airport that I stayed which was much nearer to the airport I actually preferred this better The luggage deposit service was good I can deposit my big luggages at ease and pick them up on my trip back I will stay at this hotel again if I come back ,0,125,1
 It was a great stay for a short visit We booked a triple room with breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by complimentary Dinner also being offered when we checked in The food was surprisingly nice for a complimentary buffet dinner The breakfast was nice too Lots of selection All staff members we met front desk restaurant were amazing super friendly and helpful Location was great for us because it was just a short stay before our next train ie just across the street from Milano Central but is not a walking distance to the major attraction However it was easily accessible by metro which is just outside the hotel Definitely will stay again on our next visit Great value for money no doubt ,0,125,1
 The hotel is very near a Metro station and one line takes you into the centre of Vienna What I particularly liked about this hotel is that it is not in the centre amongst a million other tourist hotels and tourists but is in a neighbourhood where real people live So you get a sense of the city from a more authentic angle Pleasant enough neighbourhood too although there are not many Viennese restaurants around The best I found was Leopold Essen Trinken which is quite near and has an outdoor eating area beside a church My room was also nice and quiet which I appreciated Hire a bike and cycle through the lovely long island park between the Danube and the canal ,0,125,1
 We travelled to Amsterdam to stay in the Ramada Apollo for my mams 50th birthday There was a group of 20 of us It wasn t only a celebration for my mam as my boyfriend decided to suprise me with asking me to marry him The hotel staff went above and beyound to help him and were so lovely to us after I can t thank them enough and couldn t recommend the hotel enough It was actually our second time to stay in the hotel which says it all really we recommended it to our family as we had such a lovely time on our first trip It s a weekend I will never forget and can t praise the staff enough ,0,125,1
 The hotel was just fabulous in every respect but it was the staff who really made it different from other similar starred properties in London I was given a mini tour on arrival and a potted history of the building before being shown to my small but beautifully decorated room and given a welcome drink The area was so quiet and the bed extremely comfortable I opted for the healthy option at breakfast which was delicious and everyone I met made me feel extremely special I only stayed for one night but received lots of little gifts in that time I would certainly stay again Yes it was an expensive treat but makes a special occasion extra special and worth every penny ,0,124,1
 Definitely geared up for business travellers and I would consider staying here for business in the future This trip was for pleasure The staff were very friendly and helpful We had booked a standard room but on arrival were advised that we had been upgraded to an executive room which was a great surprise The review is therefore based on this but if we were to go back again we d be more than tempted to go for the upgrade anyway Location was perfect for visiting nearby family Central London and theatre land is a decent tube journey away but completely do able from here and allowed for a relaxed stay without being in the middle of the madness the whole time ,0,124,1
 The studio suite was lovely and had a very well equipped kitchen it even had a dishwasher The suite was very clean The complementary breakfast was fine with a small hot selection and a larger continental breakfast selection The lounge area near reception was very comfortable and there was free coffee tea and soft drinks available 24 7 We didn t go but 3 nights a week there is a managers social evening The manager provides free alcoholic and soft drinks and snacks between 7 8 which is brilliant idea for people to mingle and meet especially if you are stopping in the a Suites for longer stays The staff were all helpful and friendly I would use the Staybridge Suites again ,0,124,1
 The hotel is almost on the Rue La Bo tie grocery store restaurents etc close to the middle section of Avenue des Champs lys es with two Metro stations Saint Philippe du Roule and Franklin D Roosevelt in quick walking distance As a result the Arc de Triomphe Place de la Concorde Trocad ro and major museums are either within walking distance or just a few Metro stops away The staff is very courteous and room maintenance impeccable On the noon of May 14th we walked the Rue La Bo tie towards Avenue des Champs lys es and saw Emmanuel Macron waving at us before his sworn in as a new president Quite an experience thanks to the location of this hotel ,0,124,1
 I treated my mum to a weekend in London after a serious operation I let the staff know before my visit and they treated us so well From the beginning of making this booking right throughout our stay the staff at the Mondrian could not have been nicer The room was beautiful I am sure we were upgraded because of the circumstances of our visit We had the best view of the Thames and southbank We were even treated to a complementary bottle of cava The restaurant is amazing and the staff there brilliant The same with the spa which is paradise I d like to thank all the staff that helped make our stay from beginning to end an amazing experience ,0,124,1
 I love that the Albany St James the hotel is nestled like a perfect secret amongst the busiest and most central locations in Paris Almost facing the Louvre and the most wonderfully decadent high end boutiques The beauty of the Albany St James for me is that after an exhausting day of shopping or visiting galleries you simply step foot into the hotel and immediately your in a luxury haven of tranquillity The principal reason I booked the hotel was it s historical connections Marie Antoinette who visited the oldest part of the Hotel when it was a private home The Hotel staff are charming and extremely helpful particularly a very friendly bar tender Lighthouse who gave us some useful local information ,0,124,1
 It was a hotel We had a beer or 2 there and slept there The location was superb straight off the eurostar and no need to carry luggage round a city we didn t know The staff were friendly Friday 28 8 15 evenings barman was brilliant Metro line 4 was down and his directions to get to some tourist places was brilliant had he not told us we wouldn t have known Cannot thank him enough We wanted to eat like locals so didn t eat at the hotel the whole place seemed very clean though We had zero view from our room but we didnt care hotels are for sleeping Would definitely stay again if in Paris or passing through ,0,124,1
 The location is perfect Short walking or tube distances to anywhere you would want to visit and explore in London So quick and easy to take public transportation from the airport The greatest surprise was the size of the room for 2 adults and 2 children it was enormous We could not have been more comfortable the beds were comfortable and the linens were fresh and inviting The bathroom was modern and spacious as well The kitchenette was a lovely surprise and very functional all in all a true 10 out of 10 I almost forgot the staff were friendly and helpful Shops bars and restaurants abound I would happily stay here again and highly recommended it to others A real gem ,0,124,1
 To be honest I was a bit afraid of choosing a hotel so close to the train station because I thought there might be the risk of paying too much money for a finally low level What I experienced in reality 2 minutes to walk from Gare du Nord Completely renovated new hotel All employees were really and honestly friendly and attentive and they obviously identified themselves with their job The concierge carried my daughthers suitcase upstairs and explained the theme idea of the hotel with abandon The breakfast was really good incl fresh scrambled eggs Due to the excellent location close to the metro hub Gare du Nord all destinations for excursions were easy to reach Would go there again immediately ,0,124,1
 The hotel is in a great location we were having dinner at the Ritz 2 minutes away In the evening we took a strolled around Piccadilly Soho and Leicester Square stopping for a Drink at Henrys Bar Green Park All the Hotel staff are friendly and helpful The room was spacious clean and comfortable the power shower was really good there is everything you need also plenty of mirrors which is unusual we had 4 in the room and the wardrobe doors had mirrors which made another 3 and 2 in the bathroom 9 in total amazing they where all clean Everything worked as it should The breakfast area is very comfortable and clean and The breakfast is plentiful and very tasty ,0,124,1
 Lovely hotel near Opera We walked down from Gare du Nord as it was a beautiful day and went through the old covered passageways Verdeau Jouffroy and Panaramas which was an interesting stroll Greeted at the hotel by Stefano who immediately got us a drink and was very helpful with information we needed We had room 16 which had a tiny courtyard seating area No view but a secluded place to sit and have a glass of wine Didn t use the spa as we had lots of things booked and the heated pool wasn t needed when it was beautiful outside Breakfast was good and had all usual things Very close to Metro station Overall a very nice stay Thank you ,0,124,1
 Contemporary design and smart rooms I loved this futuristic hotel Minimalist rooms without extra space but with all bells and whistles are entirely controlled with an i pad You can even decide how you want your room to feel selecting the mood from the i pad I found extremely interesting the list of all the alternative attractions and restaurants recommended by other guests that you can find scrolling on the i pad The position is ideal to visit the city and to have a great nightlife Shoreditch is particularly recommended to young people it has been subject to considerable gentrification in the past years with accompanying rises in interesting restaurants and bars try Cream for breakfast two minute walk from the hotel ,0,124,1
 The room had all the facilities you would want from a hotel I especially liked the computer tv great sound for listening to the radio channels Breakfast was great a very good choice of continental or full English My only problem was that we sat in the lobby which wasn t the problem but the cooked food wasn t hot and the plates were cold But we all enjoyed our breakfasts both mornings On our second morning we had a very nice young in training waiter called Daniel who was very attentive to our needs We have stayed in quite a few hotels in London over the years and I can honestly say this is one of the better ones by far ,0,124,1
 This was our second time in Amsterdam and we had plans to visit Keukenhof as well as getting from Schiphol airport so the location for that matter was really convenient The hotel is quite new and the decoration is really a plus For this price range it was a good surprise The room is cosy well decorated and had strong wifi signl We also had great quality value breakfast one day which was booked in advance they have a system to customize your stay in advance with discounts The same system asks you by mail during your stay how things are going I have reported a minor issue and got a quick response so it really worked Also enjoyed the lounge bar ,0,124,1
 Pulitzer is a great find The location is extremely central just 2 minutes across the square from the aerobus stop which makes it easy from the airport It is located on plaza Catalunya at at the top of las ramblas The hotel rooftop bar is one of the best we found in Barcelona with an awesome vibe and many locals coming for drinks The lounge in the lobby area is a great place to relax after a busy day walking The restaurant serves brekfast and lunch which were both great The lunch menu was a set menu for 12 or 15 euros and the food was exceptional Have the melon and mint soup The rooms are modern and spacious by European standards ,0,124,1
 Trendy boutique hotel in a nice area of Eixample close to Avenida Diagonal and to many good restaurants and caf s in the adjoining streets Large well appointed room with a very comfortable king size bed and a roomy walk in shower with hydro massage functions not to mention all those huge mirrors everywhere you look There is a small pool on the rooftop Wi fi works very well and there is a flat screen TV even in the toilet for those lonely moments when one might get a bit bored A word of praise for the friendly helpful and very professional staff from the good humoured people manning the 24 hour reception to the discreet efficient and non intrusive cleaning staff ,0,124,1

 Although this hotel may be a little out of the way for some people it was only a 15 minute walk to the museum quater it s situated in a residential area and is a lovely quiet place to go back to at the end of a day s sight seeing It was our wedding anniversary and we were given a complimentary room up grade with fabulous views of the canal and complimentary choccies in our room on arrival The staff were all so friendly and helpful and the harbour bar and kitchen should not be missed There is a shuttle bus to and from the airport free to the hotel and 7euros to the airport good value verses a taxi ,0,123,1
 this hotel had a good location close to the metro and train links There was a good little bakery next to the hotel which we visited for coffee and croissants each morning Check in was quick and Santiago was great giving us some tips on where to go with the kids We had a family room which was very spacious and had proper beds for the kids The decent sized fridge was an added bonus The pool was small but clean and big enough for the kids to have a quick swim each morning We didn t use the restaurant or spa so can t comment on those Overall we were impressed with this hotel and had no concerns or complaints ,0,123,1

 The whole hotel was lovely well decorated and inviting Rooms were cleaned daily including fresh towels Complementory toiletries in the room and the bed was extremely comfortable Our room was available before check in time and staff were very friendly and helpful explaining which trams to use along with providing maps We found the location absolutely fine given we spent the majority of our time in the centre probably 15 minutes travel time in total via trams Computers were available to use for free so we could print our boarding passes off Did not have breakfast or use the restaurant but I can imagine it would be lovely given the standards of the rest of the hotel Will 100 be returning ,0,123,1
 The hotel was lovely clean towels changed daily bedding re made every day toiletries replenished daily had black out curtains had free transfer to and from airport although not in the city they gave us help with bus or travel into city with a discount deal on busses and also the bus stop was literally 1 minute walk away from hotel The food was amazing Not cheap but you get what you pay for The bus is about 15 mins but takes you right into centre where it is easy accessible We didn t get discount for bus travel so cost us 10 a day for a return to city centre Near a massive lake which is nice to walk around ,0,123,1
 As soon as you walk in the hotel amazes you So luxurious with friendly staff on reception 24 7 The decor of the hotel is just amazing from the grand piano to the landing to the rooms The bed was extremely comfy and very big as well as a walk in shower and soft towels Rooms also very nice and cool in hot temperatures Hotel was always spotless and smelt amazing with nice touches such as fresh pineapple juice in your fridge every morning Also had computer and printer downstairs to print off any tickets you may need whilst staying here such as Camp Nou or Sagrada Famillia Such a luxurious feel whilst staying here and would definitely return again soon ,0,123,1

 Cozy Botique Hotel Clean Rooms Excellent location with easy access to Tube Queensway station and Bayswater District Line Also very close to Kensington Park which is worth a visit Exceptional service levels Very helpful staff with smile on their faces Helped me in booking a luxury cab till airport at very reasonable price The team has accommodated my request for an early check in by couple of hours Super speed WiFi I will surely stay back in this hotel and would strongly recommend for a comfortabl stay and pocket friendly prices Booked a club size room and I must say it was a very decent size considering London room size standards Loved overall experience Keep up the good work team ,0,122,1
 Finding a really good hotel in Paris is a tought task But I seem to have solved it with Hotel de JoBo It s a very interesting hotel with personality Everything new and stylish The room was very comfortable with good shower bed and facilities Staff was really kind helpful and tr s sympathique Always saying bonjour with a smile The location couldn t be better in the very heart of the Marais close to Place des Vosges to the les and to the best shopping and restaurants I know in Paris In comparison with other hotels I ve seen in Paris it is relatively fairly priced Remember it s a very expensive city I will definitely stay here again ,0,122,1
 The staff were so welcoming helpful and friendly This is an older historic building so it has some quirks The subtle Sherlock Holmes touches were nice Loved that the rooms have electrical outlets for US European and British appliances Our room had lots of space more than I expected and was located at the back of the building so no street nose The breakfast buffet was very English and plentiful The location was perfect a short walk or bus ride to Oxford Street shopping 2 blocks from Baker St Tube for quick access to the rest of London and Wembley Stadium Lots of fast food eateries and convenience stores close by We will definitely stay here again when visiting London ,0,122,1
 It s a very nice and cozy boutique hotel in central London with fantastic location and view It s only 5min walk to the Green Park Underground Station and easy access to most attractions So ideal for travellers It s also a very romantic place with nice Green Park view if you prefer quietness you could request for rooms not facing the main road so good choice for couples who would like to celebrate special occasions or just to have a weekend out It s a bit expensive at full price but we booked at 40 discount so feel much more value of money Would definitely recommend it to young couples or families if you are not constrained by budget ,0,122,1
 This hotel is amazing Location food staff cleanliness The views over Hyde park are spectacular Trains buses are all within minutes of the hotel Everything is just incredible really I could not fault this hotel for anything Im already booking to return for April I was sad to leave this beautiful hotel My son thoroughly enjoyed his stay and the use of all the services including the complimentary scooters to go around Hyde park During our stay my son was sick and around 3am one of the staff came up and helped me clean the room and change the bed Thank you so much you were the kindest member of staff Thank you Royal garden for everything Melissa and ross x,0,122,1
 Beatiuful warm and relaxing ambience in this hotel Amazing staircase which I preffered to use over lift every day Unique decor in every room Mini bar Great room service With delicious food Interesting area Great spot for reaching every touristy location and to take in local everydays life Monmarte ideal for artisty kind with most amazing cathedral and buzzing atmosphere just few min walk away Be openminded because you are staying in Pigalle place for lots of sex shops and place where lots of sex selling business take place you will hear it through your window in the nights or mornings If all that buzz would not bother you this place is the perfect stay Loved it would stay again ,0,122,1
 The staff were very friendly and polite The single room was comfortable and thoughtfully laid out A small thing that I particularly liked was that bottled water in the room which I drank was replaced by a fresh bottle when the room was cleaned Something that many larger hotels fail to do I think it reflects the attention to detail The bed was comfy and the room on the back of the building very quite overnight even though I had the window open The decor is not the most contemporary but its a Georgian building and it suits the style It was a great location and a good price for a central London hotel in July I will definitely book again,0,122,1
 Comfortable and clean hotel in an interesting location It s not exactly what I would call a boutique hotel though it is large breakfast felt like an all inclusive impersonal no nice touches and there is nothing really special about it The short boat trip across to Canary Warf Pier is pleasant although you do have to factor in more time when going from A to B Sitting outside on the terrace is nice but be warned if you order 2 small bottles of water at the bar to take to your room they will cost you nearly 8 which does include an unbelievable 0 9 service charge Fortunately this was deducted from my bill when I expressed my disgust ,0,122,1
 VERY friendly staff The manager cleared up for us a bug with the Booking com software cancelled room still showed up as reserved Took a club room after reading that the standard rooms were too small It was a relatively large room Very clean Requested quiet room got one in the 1st floor by the elevators but the guy who took us there swore we won t hear a thing and it was so The room was very quiet The hotel is near Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations Plenty of coffee houses nearby Took a room w o breakfast the 1st day we had breakfast at Starbucks at Paddington the 2nd day in the nice cafe in nearby Kensignton Gardens ,0,122,1
 We stayed with our seven year old daughter in a privilege room 53 which had a sliding door to separate the areas meaning we could put her to bed sofa bed and stay up to watch tv or read It was like having a two bedroom apartment in the centre of Paris The hotel was lovely and in a fantastic location close to the metro which made it easy to get to Disneyland and all the local sights and shopping right in the doorstep My daughter loved that it was just across the street from laduree too so it made it really easy for a macaron fix This was my second stay here and it will not be our last ,0,122,1
 Paris was in the grip of a very cold snap during my short stay When I arrived in my room I found out that the heating was not working I informed reception and they not only sent someone to check it immediately they offered me to change room or to bring me a powerful electric heater Let s not forget profuse apologies and the kettle I had requested on booking form came with a large assortment of teas and biscuits on top I opted for the heater and my entire stay there was snug and warm Also appreciated fast broadband and enjoyed the magazines newspapers left at guest disposal in the lobby and on every floor Will definitely go back ,0,122,1
 Henri and his entire staff were exceptionally attentive very kind and helpful my daughter and I were upgraded to a deluxe twin room with a queen sized bed original wooden beams on the walls and ceiling and a quintessential blue toile pattern on the walls and fine European linens There was a wonderful bathroom with shower and tub and a small sitting area where we could enjoy a glass of wine at the end of the day It was stunningly beautiful The hotel is about 400 feet from Notre Dame and several wonderful brasseries and a Metro stop are right there as well The Louvre Touilleries and Place de Carroussell are also five minute walks Tres bien Henri and merci millefois,0,122,1
 The hotel was situated in the most ideal location it was close to the centre of town and beautiful bars shops and restaurants However don t feel the need to wonder too far for delicious food as the Sir Albert is home to Izakaya restaurant which was some of the most exquisitely tasting Asian cuisine that I have experienced throughout my extensive travels through Europe The hotel staff were extremely helpful and accommodating ensuring that we were well accommodated and helped with whatever we may need The rooms were immaculate and clean with the most comfortable beds We could not have asked for a better hotel to stay in whilst traveling in Amsterdam I highly recommend the Sir Albert Hotel ,0,122,1
 The location of the hotel was very convenient to the Passeig de Gracia and Las Ramblas Being near Catyluna Plaza was a great help as we were able to use the airport bus to and from the airport The staff were excellent personable professional and helpful One gentleman at the front desk for example helped us with directions to a recommended restaurant and printed out a map for us On another day he helped us figure out a good route to the Sagrada Familia and showed us other Gaudi structures nearby Breakfast was super The room was bigger than expected and had an alcove with an extra bed The room was quiet All in all our stay was most enjoyable ,0,122,1
 Smart rooms that were clean and tidy Good hearty full English breakfast buffet at an extra cost of 12 available along with fruit cereals croissant and other pastries Good value for a London Hotel and was ideally located Covent Garden Chinatown within easy walking distance We like walking so were able to walk to Trafalgar square shops on regent street and many other London attractions Close enough to the Tottenham Court Road tube to make it only 3 stops away from Euston without needing to change Also close to Holborn station too The British Museum which was the reason to go in the first place was literally 200 yards away In all this is a great base to tour London ,0,122,1
 We were recommended this hotel by two separate couples and i m glad we took their advice When you first step into the hotel you re in a very impressive colourful and modern reception with friendly and helpful staff at both the reception and elsewhere in the hotel The food and drinks were delicious and the rooms were tasteful clean and felt very designer The hotel s location is exactly right its about 15 minutes from central station via the tram and I d definitely recommend the tram with their 1 24 or 48 hour passes You get to see a lot more of the city and have a better idea of how to find everything you re looking for ,0,122,1
 The rooms were beautifully appointed and clean and the flowers that were provided stayed fresh the entire week we were there The staff was extremely accommodating and helpful Their restaurant recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed each meal We enjoyed having a drink or cappuccino in the Library every evening and talking to each of the bartenders each one was so personable and attentive My friend had misplaced her sweater and by chance asked if anyone had turned it in to the front desk and the next morning the sweater was returned to her She thought she d lost it in on a visit to Den Haag I would highly recommend the Ambassaade for a carefree destination in Amsterdam ,0,122,1
 I must say I ve stayed in several hotels of different styles and stars around the world and this is one of the best hoteles I ve ever stayed at not only the rooms must say that one thing I always notice is the quality of the bathroom towels nothing worst than getting dry with a rough towel in this case they felt like cotton location grab breakfast at Spingel 404 if you can great breakfast but above all THE SERVICE is absolutely fantastic they go far and beyond any request from early checkin late checkout 2am room service bike rentals etc Oh plus they left us a box of chocolates in the room and they were outstanding Absolutely recommended ,0,122,1
 Staff was very friendly The hotel is located very close to central station so getting to and from the airport is a breeze You are a little out of the way from the main hustle and bustle of the city This can be good for getting away from the noise but bad for adding an extra 3 5 minute walking commute to top sites The Sky Lounge was a great hangout spot with wonderful views of the city Great place to watch the sunset Friday evening was very busy and so was Sunday when we stopped in for a quick drink Hotel helped with tickets to some top sites and also gave us some great suggestions for late night partying ,0,122,1
 The hotel is very well located on a quiet and attractive canal at a convenient comfortable distance from Amsterdam city centre and Central Station The staff are friendly very hospitable and happy to make recommendations and bookings for guests there are many delightful local restaurants with excellent food within minutes of the hotel The decor of the hotel itself is excellent and tasteful while the facilities are of a high standard with reliable fast wi fi not always the case in European hotels the provision of self catering facilities in the room is also a significant plus though we only made use of the coffee tea making facilities on this occasion We certainly plan to return on future visits to Amsterdam,0,122,1
 Bed was so comfy And huge Overall the room was pretty great Controlling it with an iPad was quite nifty Toilet and shower being in the room didn t faze us at all There s a curtain that can be drawn across that area if you re a bit shy Staff were really friendly helpful too Loved the whole concept of the place Brilliant literature and art all around you 24hr bar Clever incentive to help the environment Couldn t really recommend the place more Tram stop was just outside 1 tram ride to city centre but takes almost half an hour I think that s the only slight negative I can think of Just fantastic Will definitely be back ,0,122,1
 Wonderful hotel Beautifully decorated and in a great location So many restaurants and cafes nearby Right next to the 9 streets shopping areas which was also a plus We could also walk to all the major museums Truly felt as though we were in a magical little place We loved how unique the hotel felt as compared to larger hotels Our room faced the street which was not loud at all at least compared to NYC Would certainly recommend Note We are in our mid twenties and the rest of the guests seemed much older than us by a decade or two We didn t mind at all but something to consider if you are looking for a younger hotel ,0,122,1
 Absolutely fab hotel staff location and all the Christmas feeling in the hotel the dining room and staff there are just superb and so friendly any time if day also the guy that took our luggage unfortunately never got his name but he always had a big welcome either when u were leaving or arriving room attendant was a lovely woman always smiling and room spotless thanks you also for the st Nicholas gift we got on one of the nights we returned back to room what a lovely thought We definitely will be back to hotel Stefanie and as for Vienna it s a stunning city just loved every piece of it Best regards Patrick and Dolores Harte Room 322,0,122,1
 This is my second time staying at the hotel Regina and I would stay the next time I go too Love the location because it is central to everything About 7 mins walk away from duomo 15 from brera and 15 from navigli The street that it is located on has lots of shops and some good ones too so you don t have to always go to the duomo area to find something The breakfast buffet in the morning is fantastic The food is delicious and there are also gluten free options Overall my experience at hotel Regina made my stay in Milan wonderful The service is excellent the rooms and nice and clean and the location is superb ,0,122,1
 The best guest relations I ve ever encountered All the hotel staff was extremely friendly helpful and caring We felt as if we were staying in a luxurious hotel in terms of service For instance Desy the guest relations manager was exceptionally nice and treated hotel us as family members She prepared nice presents for us upon our arrival organic cosmetics sweet treats and wrote a warm welcoming message on the mirror in the bathroom They were inspiring us during the entire stay When we were leaving for the airport she packed sandwiches and water for us We will definitely choose Nhow Milan again Many thanks to all the people working in the hotel for making our stay so special ,0,122,1
 All in all a nice little hotel nearby the center of Amsterdam However u need some time to get to the most visited places 8min by bike 25min by foot The room is too small for what it costs But it is clean an the bed is comfortable the basics are just fine But nothing special with the room We were even a little disappointent The breakfast doesent offer a big variety but what u find there tastes really good so it gives a good start in the day Well its a nice little hotel where u can have a nice stay but next time we will definately go somewhere else It is just too expensive for what it offers ,0,122,1
 We didn t avail of breakfast or any of the hotel facilities as it was a rushed stay attending an event at the 02 However I give this hotel ten out of ten The staff are very professional helpful and friendly The large room had a beautiful view of the estuary and skyscrapers The king sized bed was so comfortable and the pillows were sublime it was like sleeping in a hug We arrived early 1pm and the staff were exceptionally kind and allowed us to check in early Check out is 12pm which is excellent There is a walk way from the hotel to the 02 which closes at 1am I will definitely be returning to this hotel ,0,121,1
 I stay at this hotel on a fairly regular basis The staff are friendly and efficient and you are always greeted with a smile The rooms I have stayed in vary in size but the beds are super comfy This is one time when size doesn t matter There is everything you need in the room iron with ironing board kettle coffee machine hairdryer as well as toiletries in the bathroom Plenty of electrical sockets for your gadgets too I don t always have breakfast when I stay there but there is a fabulous choice of both continental as well as cooked For me there s no other place I d rather stay when in London Definitely highly recommended ,0,121,1
 The hotel is five minutes from the Louvre and the Sienne so we could spend our time sight seeing not travelling The staff are friendly and helpful The reception is open 24 hours so we could get back late without a hassle They also allowed us to store our luggage before check in and after check out for a few hours so we din t have to lug our case around on our first and last days The breakfast was lovely and plentiful so we only needed a light lunch saving a fortune in expensive Paris The room was clean and very comfortable and quite big by Paris standards It overlooked the Rue Des Pyramides but was not noisy ,0,121,1
 We enjoyed our time here so much Very clean and modern room beautifully decorated comfortable huge bed Luxury hotel and when we booked 6 months earlier it was pretty cheap too With darkening curtains you could get the room very dark so it was very pleasant to sleep No noise Air conditioning worked really well which was a blessing cause it was 30 degrees outside Staff was very friendly and helpful they held our packbags the whole day when we checked out Location is good only 5 minute walk to the metro station 45 min walk to most of the turist attractions if you prefer walking like we did Warmly recommend this hotel for everyone Nothing bad to say ,0,121,1

 The interior of this hotel is I would say unique The building is lovely and they have done an amazing job of redeveloping it into a stylish and extremely comfortable hotel Our room was lovely as well as quiet The Hotel is in a fabulous location The street is vibrant during the day and quieter at night The Ile Saint Louis generally is the perfect place to stay to explore the centre of Paris There are plenty of places to eat nearby and it is a 3 minute walk to Notre Dame and the Siene Highly recommend in every way We also fell in love with the Hotel dog even though we only saw it once all too briefly ,0,121,1

 We arrived at this hotel after staying in a not so great hotel and really appreciated the extremely comfy bed and the lovely bathroom It was a 5 minute walk to the top of La Rambla and better still a 5 minute walk to the gothic quarter where there are some great restaurants The hotel was easy to landmark and therefore find our way home after a fun night out eating tapas and drinking the local beer and of course Sangria The staff were very friendly welcoming and helpful I would definitely recommend this hotel BTW if you are going on a cruise starting or ending in Barcelona this hotel is a 10 Euro taxi ride to the Port ,0,121,1
 The common spaces could be refurbished and more clean The elevator doors wouldn t open in the 3rd floor when we ask for it so many times we descend by stairs The acoustic isolation was as I think inexistent So I could easily ear all conversation and sex of next door As they could ear mine Never the less the front desk did give us a bathroom renovated room when we complain in the check in Breakfast was good with some variety but isn t worth the 20 person standard price You might consider low this to 12 50 1st night discount price as it is an important issue when choosing hotel and you might be loosing room occupation ,0,121,1
 This hotel was in walking distance of all the attractions Tram stop nearby We had a room at the back which was quite small but very clean with a great shower room and overlooked the canal It was very quiet and peaceful The staff were all excellent very friendly and super helpful They were able to give excellent advice about which attractions to visit and how to get to them They were very helpful in sorting out a couple of small personal problems we had on our arrival with items we had forgotten to bring The bed was comfortable and there was a good range of breakfast choices A great stay Would visit again and would recommend to friends ,0,121,1
 The staff were friendly and helpful the bed was comfortable the room was quiet and nicely furnished the breakfast was delicious the restaurant food was good the location was good and the price was reasonable plus the hotel has an interesting history It s not modern or trendy but it was a very nice place to stay There was nothing we didn t like And Vienna was wonderful we loved it and you can walk easily from the Stefanie to anywhere in the historic centre of Vienna And once you ve tired yourself out from the day s exploring you can catch a tram back to the bridge and it s just a short walk back to the hotel ,0,121,1
 We flew to Vienna and got the CAT into Wien Mitte It was then roughly ten minutes on foot to the hotel which was useful The hotel is just over the river and about 5 minutes walk to the city and bars etc All staff we dealt with were helpful happy and had a good sense of humour Cannot fault them at all The room had the basics but we didn t need much more the shower was good and WIFI excellent throughout the hotel We only ate breakfast once and we got there very late so a lot of food was done with but there still seemed to be a decent spread All in all a positive stay ,0,121,1
 This is the second time we spent a night at this hotel The value for money is excellent The suites are very well equipped a bit outdated but they have everything you might need are super comfortable and are perfectly clean Heating is good plenty of hot water also even in the top floor and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever seen in any hotel Staff is very friendly and they are there to help you Location is very good not totally central but tram and metro is right there and it takes only a few minutes to get to the center or one stop to Wien Hauptbahnhof main train station I totally recommend this hotel ,0,121,1

 A really fun place to stay and what a location only a few minutes walk away from Covent Garden Loved the eclectic d cor and the trendy vibe of this place My room was a double but was pretty compact Not a lot of room if you had big luggage with you and very little clothes hanging space For a one night stay in London though excellent Everything very clean a comfortable bed and a quiet room Liked the breakfast bag left outside the door in the morning A banana granola and orange juice just enough to keep you going until coffee time Nice to have a fridge in the room and some actual milk in it too ,0,120,1
 It was our first time at this particular DoubleTree by Hilton hotel and we couldn t fault anything The reception was warm and friendly we came early on the day of check in and the lady was happy to put our suitcase in the storage room until we returned later in the day when we could check in At the time of check in we received two delicious cookies and the room was equipped with a nespresso coffee machine a simply perfect combination Everything was super clean and we had a great stay The location is fantastic as well very close to the centre a couple of minutes walk to the tube station We will definitely be back ,0,120,1

 We very much enjoyed our stay The staff was friendly and the service provided was that of a 5 star hotel The bathrooms are a little dated but the service and attentiveness of the staff and the overall approach of the hotel was fantastic and made this easy to overlook The lobby is very comfortable as well and we enjoyed unwinding there in the afternoon The touch of a live piano player was wonderful Finally our 30 year old daughter who lives in London decided to stay with us on the last night we were there and the staff quickly arranged for a cot in the room We look forward to staying at this hotel in the future ,0,120,1
 Very clean hotel tastefully decorated Excellent location 1 min walk from a major metro stop 5 min walk to the base of the Arc de Triomphe and a 10 min walk to the Champs lys es lots of places to eat around the hotel Extremely courteous and helpful staff who solved every problem and issue for us if there were any Rooms are big by Paris and European standards Absolutely no complaints and would repeat our stay here whenever we are in Paris Breakfast is good but could have been better but maybe since all other aspects of the hotel set such high standards we are being a bit harsh Lovely property and amazing hospitality from the staff ,0,120,1
 We always have a great time here Excellent location and great service management The hotel might be better suited for a bit older kids rather than toddlers We went to patisserie Paul every morning just around the corner for the best breakfast croissants and coffee The hotel breakfast is quite good too but not worth the money to be honest Bonus they have great fish n chips in the hotel restaurant The cutest area for evening strolls is South Kensington a 5 7 min slow walk or 2 stops with the bus where you can find good restaurants and great ice cream open late When reserving a room ask for a newly refurbished executive room they are great ,0,120,1
 Great staff Girl at the reception was very helpful and friendly just like the rest of the staff The location is a bit outside of the central area but you can buy a tram ticket for a couple of days and the tram operates every 2 5 minutes very nearby You can buy the tickets at the reception Very clean modern and spacious rooms Breakfast was nice although it s the same every day We ended up buying it separately as you never know is it really good or bad until you get to the hotel but I can also recommend prebuying it to save a few Bought separately it was 19 per person if I can recall ,0,120,1
 This was the most amazing place to stay in Vienna Everything starting with the location on the most authentic quiet street of Vienna but just off the main drag 5 min from the Opera WITH your luggage to the hotel design traditional Viennese breakfast public area and room was so very authentic and adorable We had to come back later to Vienna for just one more night and we booked this hotel again although it was more expensive as our initially booked place for that night The spiral staircase the pictures on the wall your room names the way the breakfast is being presented are absolutely unique and you feel a very pampered guest in this unique hotel ,0,120,1
 After traveling for four weeks in four countries in Europe this hotel was my favorite I was nervous at first thinking that since it s a chain hotel that it wouldn t have charm but it was the opposite the staff was super friendly helpful and knowledgable I hope the manager realizes how professional and kind his staff is The breakfast as well as the restaurant staff was AMAZING It was healthy and fresh and had something for everyone The beds were the most comfy we slept in during our entire trip The bathrooms were also really nice The location is also really convenient Thanks for a great stay We will be back Did I mention that breakfast ,0,120,1
 Very friendly helpful staff who all spoke fluent english The hotel is located just a short walk to the Opera House palaces and the other main tourist attractions of Vienna Nearby are taxi ranks and a local farmers market selling cheeses sausages and other local delicacies offering places where you can sit and have a coffee and crossiant or breakfast The suite family room was comfortable and air conditioned with fridge coffee maker kettle and a kitchenette for families with younger children Free wi fi I booked two months in advance and received a good advance booking rate For a main capital city in Europe right in the centre it was very reasonable and in a good location ,0,120,1
 This is the second time I have stayed at the Havana with its very friendly and helpful staff ideal location and really nice facilities including the restaurant which serves very good food La Rambla Passeig de Gr cia Gaud s La Pedrera Casa Batll La Sagrada Familia and even the beaches are within walking distance some walks being longer than others If walking to places like the Gran Teatre del Liceu and the Tablao Cordob s for Flamenco is too far then there are taxis waiting outside the hotel for ease of transport Public transport is also nearby The Havana is a lovely hotel and one that I would definitely recommend for a trip to this wonderful city ,0,120,1

 It s a beautiful place to stay in Barcelona a rare case when reality exceeds expectations created by online images The hotel is in a great location close to all the popular Gaudi s masterpieces and 15 min away from express train to the airport The room was clean and tastefully decorated A coffee table was a bit worn out but the rest of the furniture seemed flawless The menu of pillows is an interesting perk There were a bottle of water coffee and tea sets in the room Gym was good sauna was awesome Check out the rooftop which provides magnificent panoramic views The local restaurant on the 2nd level pleased with impecable service and delicious meals ,0,120,1

 Another pleasant weekend in this hotel friendly polite and helpful staff At the reception they helped us to book a tour nothing is trouble they were happy to help Very comfortable room we asked for a quiet room and it was really quiet not a noise from outside or from other guests in the hotel The breakfast buffe is very good many choices of coffee and tea juices honey marmelades cold and hot breakfast too sausages bacon tomatoes champignons scrambled eggs We d like to see more usual panne riche baguette We d appreciate also some more TV channels that speak English not dubbed to French or with English subtitles for us who do not speak French ,0,119,1
 Windermere is one of the four hotels I stayed during my trip in the UK and it is the best To be fair the other hotels are also good however you can find the same ones everywhere around the world Windermere is unique Every minute I spent there I knew I am in London Thank Emily for recommending the Tate 2 Tate ferry which made our journey easier and timesaving Thank Muna the route to the airport you advised was double helpful And the generous young man your name I can speak but feel hard to spell thank you so much assisting my friend in negotiating with the cab driver she said that you had rescued her ,0,119,1
 The hotel location was convenient located within walking distance to the London Eye and Big Ben There was always a black cab waiting outside the hotel for when we wanted to travel a bit further There are some small cafes and a grocery store with ATM right next store Overall the staff was very friendly One memeber of management was a bit rude but this was quickly forgotten as everyone else from the Receptionist to the Cocktail Server went above and beyond to assist us The carpets look like they could use a god cleaning but everything else was very nice and very clean It was a fair price for location and offerrings I would stay again ,0,119,1
 From the time we got there to the time we were checking out the staff at this hotel was phenomenal The rooms are squeaky clean and very spacious The bed was so comfortable we found it hard to get up We also had breakfast ordered up to our room which was great we really felt like they look after all of their guests We also tried out the swimming pool which was also very clean and quiet which was lovely and the opening hours are very ideal especially if you go out during the day you can have a cheeky swim in the evening I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again ,0,119,1
 The hotel is completely unique never been to a hotel like it before Although the rooms were small they were big enough for the 2 of us without getting under each others feet The added bonus of the free drinks were great After travelling all morning the last thing I wanted was to have to find a drink or carry one up from the bar with luggage The staff were all really friendly and went above and beyond to help us with our stay The movies included were also brilliant for ending a long day We did have breakfast here there was a good selection of hot and cold items which helped to kick start our day ,0,119,1
 We were there for a very sad occasion but the warm greeting of the staff and helpful upbeat attitude was lovely The location would be really good if you were on a mini break and sightseeing We know the area well and it is also great for restaurants etc It is a busy area at night so you must expect some noise The beds are comfy the rooms very clean with all the standard facilities and we loved the breakfast which we were able to eat outside because of the lovely weather that day a very comprehensive continental buffet including great croissants and excellent coffee Thank you for making a sad return to London a little sweeter ,0,119,1

 Could not have asked for a better hotel whilst staying in London My sister and I had bought a trip to London for my Mom s 60th birthday and we thought The Grand was reasonable The room was big compared to others I ve stayed in in London and the room was ready upon arrival at 11 30 which was a pleasant surprise We checked in and were on our way When we returned in the evening the sofa bed was made up and extra towels were in the room as requested The staff could not have done any more for us and the location was brilliant only a 2 minute walk to Charing Cross Tube Station ,0,119,1
 Standard check in time was already good at 14 00 On arrival around 12 30 our room was ready so we could settle in and then make the most of our short stay in London When I realised it was a very large hotel I wondered if there would be delays and possibly poor service at breakfast When we went down 9 30 on Saturday that was definitely not the case We were shown to a table immediately the buffets were well stocked the hot food was fresh and hot no complaints at all We did notice a plate of pastries and muffins where the queue would have been if there was one so they were prepared ,0,119,1
 This four star hotel is conveniently situated just a few minutes stroll from the Beach promenade local restaurants including a 25 minute walk into the town centre past the Zoo A very welcoming entrance with friendly staff happy to help any way they can large comfortable rooms with expansive bathrooms The only down side is that it is expensive to eat and park within the hotel as it s 16 per day for parking and 15 each for breakfast per day Good facilities within the room including coffee and tea and free WIFI There is also a lovely pool terrace bar and gym though we didnt use these Overall a pleasant stay if you have the budget ,0,119,1
 The hotel was a lot better than in the pictures on Booking com The staff were very friendly as they always are when I visit Amsterdam The rooms were spacious with 2 double beds which were very comfortable The bar is very nice we each had a hot drink before bed The barman was very friendly and the ambience is very relaxing Unfortunately didn t get to make the most of this hotel and it s facilities as it was literally a stop over for 9 hours we arrived late in the evening to check in and was checking out at 5am to get our connecting flight home I did love the Angry Birds in the Lift ,0,119,1
 The breakfast buffet is huge Full of options for anything you would like to eat Fabulous place to stay for any American s who have not traveled around Spain much This place was the most Americanized location we stayed in Wider spaces and a large shower Noticed the hotel parking is immediately adjacent to the hotel although we did not make use of it Rooms are incredibly quiet even thought we had a window facing the very busy main thoroughfare through the city Great location for walking to Olympic areas and not terribly far for a walk to the Ramblas the beach the zoo Everything touristy that Barcelona has to offer Staff if suuuuper friends and helpful ,0,119,1
 I arrived after long haul flight from Australia feeling very unwell The hotel staff were excellent in expediting a room arranging Doctor and collecting my prescription in extremely efficient helpful and pleasant manner I spent my time in Amsterdam predominantly in my room which was very comfortable On my departure a charming porter walked my luggage with me to my train He made sure my luggage was safe and I was comfortable This is such wonderful customer service and not readily discovered in our modern world I absolutely recommend each and every member of your team who made my stay a much more pleasant experience than it could have been with ill health Compliments to you all ,0,119,1
 This is our second time at the hotel and it has not fallen short of our expectations again The location is central the rooms are comfortable and the room facilities are designed for guests comfort The bed mattress is so comfortable that you would not want to leave the bed Staff is professional My husband had his birthday during the stay The hotel management arranged special treats Also the lovely lady at the breakfast restaurant presented my husband with special chocolate treat These little things do add scores to the hotel We even booked The Langham Hotel Boston for our next trip with full confidence of high quality service we ll get in this chain of hotels ,0,119,1
 It s is my 5th time in NH City Center and I was very surprised to learn that the hotel was renovated just recently I think the hotel is perfect especially for families thanks to its great location Spui is close to 9 streets just behind Kalverstraat Rokin The Dam Flower market all are 5 10 min walks with kids and Jordaan is 20 min walk with kids What more can you ask Well the street is full with restaurants Luden is just down the stairs and Italian Dante as well Asian restaurant across and at least 5 more place to eat or drink in 100 meter distance Spui street is perfect my favorite street in Amsterdam ,0,119,1

 The hotel is really nice it s new and modern It s located in a very residential part of Milan which worried me at first but traveling to the city center took about 15 20 so it wasn t too bad plus it was very safe I had the best breakfast every day at this local bakery 2 minutes away from the hotel I enjoyed seeing the locals interact with each other at the bakery instead of seeing a bunch of tourists It definitely makes the travel experience better because you get a taste of how it is to live there I was also very surprised by the size of the hotel room It was really spacious ,0,119,1
 The hotel was spotlessly clean throughout Small and compact bedroom with crisp white bed linen No tv but had iPad and phone and good wifi connection meant that a tv was not necessary Unusual design and concept for a hotel with the feel of being on a boat or barge but it worked really well as it was situated on water with great visual surroundings Emirates cable car a stones throw away and DLR minutes away made this a perfect location to get to any entertainment venue The living room and lounge area was spacious and modern The food was good Friendly staff Perfect hotel for a stop over on a night out Will definitely return back ,0,119,1
 I liked the main Hall therefore there are very friendly and kindly staff It s really close to the underground station Gloucester where you can arrive with a few couple of stops in Piccadilly Circus You can reach Harrods 10 minutes on foot Kensington Gardens Hyde park and Royal Albert Hall just 500m by walk and it s very close the Natural Historic Museum Therefore if u wanna have a good breakfast you can take something in the best Boulangerie called Paul in the opposite side of the hotel To sum up I really enjoyed my stay here and I wanna recommend this hotel If I come back in London I ll stay here for sure ,0,118,1
 Good location near Lambeth Bridge and Tate Britain On John Islip Street but a back entrance lets you out directly onto the Thames Nearest Tube station is Pimlico but it isn t too much further to walk to Vauxhall or Westminster Staff all very pleasant and helpful both at Reception and breakfast We had booked an Executive Room so were able to avail ourselves of the wine and canap s on Friday evening before our trip to the theatre We could have had breakfast in the Executive Lounge too but chose to eat in the main restaurant where there is a lot more choice at no extra cost Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice Lovely bread ,0,118,1
 Amazing hotel Loved all the technology and the modern feel Staff were so friendly and helpful even offering to go and buy a bottle of wine locally as it is a halal Room was great and the addition of a free phone to make free national and international calls as well surfing the net was a unique touch Food in the restaurant from the half board menu was beautifully presented and tasty the teriyaki chicken was the nicest I ve had and the chocolate fondant pud oozed melted chocolate just as it should Would totally recommend this hotel to anyone staying in that area it s only 5 minutes walk away from Stratford High Street DLR ,0,118,1
 My fiance and I love this hotel so much The receptionist was very friendly and helpful who was willing to share some info with us on the map though we didn t really need it Hotel s location is great though not within the 1st or 2nd arrondissement However there are a few metro stations nearby which make it a strategic location There s a supermarket and a pharmacy store down the street too Hotel s room was clean and neat modern furnishing Oh and they have complimentary tea and cookies next to the reception desk too Highly recommend to those who want to stay at a nice pretty boutique hotel yet at an affordable price ,0,118,1
 It was a good location for The Shard and for Southbank which was our main purpose for our trip So location from that perspective was perfect for us but we would look elsewhere for our next trip to London purely down to the location only being good for those attractions in my opinion We didn t use any of the amenities in the hotel check in and out was pleasant enough the room was an average size but the bathroom was lovely and big its nice to have a bath with option of a shower Could probably fit a stand alone shower in that bathroom which would be good as opposed to shower over the bath ,0,118,1
 The extremely friendly and obliging staff Located on a quiet sidestreet close to metro station Lot different restaurants and caf s near for Hotel We stayed at room nr303 and there was a good bed and view to a quiet street Wifi worked perfectly New and superclean bathroom Well balanced decorated in room and bathroom Effecient cleaning every day Easy access to the metro Breakfast was simple but superb We visited a lot of recommended restaurants but this was one of the few who worked on Sunday after 3 30 AM and the service was very fast and the cook was very clean and the food is very tasty La Bistrot 79 rue Blanche 75009 Paris ,0,118,1
 We can only say all the best about our stay at this hotel We give our highest score to the reception staff comfort and housekeeping We are a young couple that were on the go for our entire stay which means that we needed a big breakfast to conquer all the beauty that Paris has to offer us as tourists we needed a comfortable bed and some peace and quiet in the night and thats what we got Also a good thing about this hotel is the location We were so close to all the happenings but still in a part of the city where we could experience the typical small streets boutiques creperies and brasseries ,0,118,1
 With so much to do in London we ran out of time so were very happy to discover that when we returned to the hotel at around 10 45pm we were still able to dine in the bar There was a good choice on the menu Our food arrived quickly and we enjoyed it very much Following a great night s sleep breakfast was of the highest standard with a range and quality of food that would be hard to beat Staff in all departments were most welcoming and helpful Ideally situated between King s Cross and Covent Garden this is a hotel that we have visited before and would not hesitate to do so again ,0,118,1
 Location was excellent We love the Barre Gotic in Barcelona and have stayed there before This location was even better than before Close to everything and walking distance to so much more Amazing restaurants and shopping at our doorstep The hotel was really good Clean and confortable and nice to have air conditioning We had our 16 year old son in the same room on a sofa bed It Was a double sofa bed and there was still room for our 3 cases Not a problem but weird was the liftconfiguration From reception you take a lift to 2nd floor and then walk to the back of the hotel and get the lifts to your floor ,0,118,1
 The building of this hotel is bit grey and dull But as soon as you enter the the building you will see a very spacious and light lobby and friendly staff welcoming you I have booked one night at this hotel for only 50 inclusive breakfast This hotel is new in Amsterdam You can smell the newness of the hotel from the bed sheets the furniture the badroom and the carpet The rooms are very spacious and comfortable Altough this is hotel is not in the city center but you can reach the city center in 5 min with the train which departure every 10 min You can just to the train station in 5 min ,0,118,1
 Upon arrival at the hotel check in was very quick Our rooms were clean but were a bit small The hotel doesn t have a pool and does charge extra for the spa but that didn t bother us as we spent a lot of time outside of the hotel enjoying the sights in Barcelona The location of the hotel is a bit out of town but there are plenty of taxis around that will charge you 10 Euros for a trip into the center of the city Overall the hotel is good vale for money and offers an excellent service The breakfast is nice and the staff within the hotel are very friendly and helpful ,0,118,1
 Loved the look the ambiance modern and elegant and artsy the staff the room the shower the most comfortable bed ever the amenities soap shower gel shampoo breakfast and the snack left after 11 30 am you could come in at any time and find soft drinks coffee sandwiches salads wine honor pay simply a wonderful experience When I go back that s where I will stay and great location also My window faced a brick wall they put a shelf on the entire wall with plants so you had a view just beautiful took pictures Also the rooftop terrace where they had wine soft drinks and snack overlooking the city good place to wind down ,0,118,1

 We booked a Club Room which while on its own wasn t particularly better than others was well worth the extra cost as it included breakfast which was excellent use of the Club Lounge which was a great benefit offering free drinks snacks afternoon tea etc all day and free enhanced wifi throughout our stay If wifi is important to you the normal cost of this was 20 night so is well worth the Club Room cost The staff throughout the hotel were extremely helpful and pleasant making a huge effort to make the stay a good one The location of the hotel was perfect with Central Station Canal Cruises Dam Square all within minutes walk ,0,118,1
 We often visit Vienna but last week was the first time we stayed in Das Opernring Hotel We really like the location across from the Opera 2 minutes walk to downtown Vienna Room and bathroom are very spacious and very clean It was extremely hot last week in Vienna and the first night my husband got sick I asked the hotel to cancel the 2nd night because we wanted to get home asap and the hotel was kind enough to reimburse our second night as we had already paid for it in advance I ve never experienced this professionalism in any other hotel so thanks again for your kind gesture Special thanks to Harald and Kyle ,0,118,1
 After we failed to checkin to another property we booked for our stay as we were running late and the property wasn t answering during their checkin hours we were left out on the street late in the evening We were desperately looking for a last minute shelter in Vienna that won t cost us a fortune I booked this property 10mins before checkin time and phoned them to let them know that we are on our way asked them to please wait for us They actually answered the phone unlike the previous property and waited for us unlike the previous property The receptionist was very nice and helpful we were very happy with the service ,0,118,1
 From the moment we arrived we were made to feel valued and cared for From the valet car service to the fact that we were upgraded to the most beautiful penthouse suite because it was my birthday The bed was sublime the breakfast was excellent and every single member of staff that we came into contact with was attentive and friendly nothing was too much trouble We left feeling rested revitalised and refreshed In a nutshell I would say that the comfort of this hotel is incredible but what really makes it exemplary is its exquisite care and attention to the client Auguri to the management and all the staff We hope to return very soon ,0,118,1
 The interior of the hotel is really nice a combination of classic and modern elements Same is valid for the rooms Everybody of the staff is very welcoming The breakfast dinner drinks and snacks in the integrated restaurant bistro bar were also great The location is also perfect 10 min walk from the central station 15 20 min walk until the center depending on how you let yourself be distracted by the fashion district you are walking through In case you are not up for walking the metro station is just around the corner It doesn t take more than five minutes to reach duomo In a nutshell A perfect experience At least for our requirements ,0,118,1
 Our family of 4 2 adults 2 kids under 10 stayed at this property in July 2017 To be honest we had a mixed experience On the plus side we appreciated the complementary parking and the complementary breakfast Our room was clean with good water pressure though everything looked old dated The property is also within walking distance 10 minutes to the Milan subway system On the negative side the staff at the front desk and especially the front gate are unfriendly and we did not feel safe outside the hotel area after dusk I would recommend this hotel if you re looking for something close to the Milan subway system but otherwise I would not ,0,118,1
 Amazing staff and hotel close to city center What I consider a great and valuable idea is the mineral water in the room minibar There are as well other hotels which offer a free bottle of water but in this hotel you have enough bottles a refilled fridge everyday in order to drink and take away with you during your journey in Milan A small innovation that goes to great things Hotel is looking nice outside and inside cosy rooms amazing personnel especially the lady receptionist that resembles Selma Hayek Breakfast buffet is very good having enough variety for everyone served inside or outside on the terrace There is also available a bar on the rooftop ,0,118,1
 everything was lovely I especially like the black glass theme all over the hotel had a real sofisticated look I stayed here as I had an appointment at St thomas for an operation It was just across the road so ideally located The room had a really relaxing feel just what you need befor an op will defo stay here again next time I ll stay longer and get an upgrade with views although we could see big Ben we had to look sideways out of the window but was still good Ideally set for anyone visiting London everything you want to see is on the doorstep or just a short walk or taxi ride away ,0,118,1
 Absolutely fantastic place to stay Me and my partner didn t want to leave The service was amazing so friendly and willing to help in any way to make your stay that much better We stayed here because we were going to a concert at the O2 and loved the fact that you could walk straight in from the hotel The bedroom was lovely very high end finish and could tell that your comfort was top priority when it was designed and built Talking about comfort the bed was the best iv slept in and when I got home my own bed felt inadequate Will 100 be staying here on my next visit to London ,0,117,1
 Definitely book the garden rooms They re worth the money The garden rooms were lovely and I asked for a high level room which was provided so the views were amazing overlooking kensington gardens I also requested for a message to be left in the room when we arrive for my mother as this trip was her gift on Mother s day The staff not only left a message but also a plate of delicious chocolate truffles They definitely go the extra mile The hotel is situated at the start of kensington high street so access to great shopping is a stones throw away Twin beds were nice and comfy and the bathroom is great ,0,117,1

 I stayed here for 2 nights when doing Ride London There were a number of cyclists staying at the hotel and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly They allowed me to keep my bike in the bedroom and put out breakfast on Sunday from 5am instead of the normal time The breakfast was excellent and we also ate in the restaurant on Sunday evening and that was very good and not overly expensive The room was comfortable and well sound proofed The hotel was very convenient for both Excel and the Olympic Park so definitely recommended for anyone doing Ride London in the future as well as anyone wanting to stay near Canary Wharf ,0,117,1
 This hotel was nice Very clean close proximity to the Arc de Triumphe and room was nicely decorated However we visited on our honeymoon which we advised the hotel of before arrival and this was never even acknowledged I wasn t expecting freebies but a congratulations on arrival would have been nice Not a big issue but it did deflate our initial excitement at arriving in beautiful Paris Hotel is quiet so this is a good base if you plan on being out all day and want a nice hotel to come back to in the evenings to sleep All in all we did enjoy our stay but would perhaps avoid for a special occasion ,0,117,1

 It was my second visit to this hotel and I m afraid my first visit a couple of years ago was better than this one My main concern was the bathroom that may need some renovation and cleanliness was not very good with a greasy feeling on door handles the fan surfaces etc Nothing that can t be fixed by thorough cleaning though Breakfast was very good and location perfect so thumbs up on those Wi Fi is ok in the lobby but not so good in room 216 breaking the connection every 2 3 minutes Anyway this is a good match if you are looking for value for money and enjoy Barcelona ,0,115,1
 The staff was really nice and helpful The included breakfast was basic but the quality was very good I liked the mordern style of the entire facilities from entrance our room to the breakfast area The room had the perfect size and was modern but still suprisingly cozy Towls Soap Coffee Tea Water and Lemonade was provided in the room In terms of location it is a little but outside of the city center but there is a train station only 5min walking distance from the hotel By train it takes about 10 15min to the city center I will definetly try to stay at Jaz Amsterdam again if I go to Amsterdam ,0,115,1
 It was the weekend of the Camden Registry Office Wedding We were offered a room on the 5th floor on arrival which was excellent as we were early However when we got to it someone came out so it appeared it was already occupied It turned out to be management using it for room audit purposes and he the manager apologised profusely and took us downstairs to be allocated a different room for our inconvenience the hotel provided us with a bottle of Verve champagne as an apology Really well looked after and would definitely stay again The Booking Office bar is excellent and service great as it was at breakfast each morning ,0,115,1
 All staff were amazing they responded to our email confirming our requests before traveling When we arrived the guest relation personnel meat us and went through all the hotel facilities and escorted us to our beautiful room where we found a lovely card congratulating my husband for his birthday and us for our 40th wedding anniversary a bottle of champagne and a delicious chocolate cake the location of the hotel is at an excellent location very accessible to all attractions and within walking distance in the classy quiet suburb L eixample the decor is grand we felt we are staying in a palace we loved the roof top garden we highly recommend it ,0,115,1
 My partner and I had a great stay here I noticed a lot of really negative reviews about the hotel breakfast and I was hesitant to eat there But the food was absolutely amazing and fresh Yes it was expensive but the quality is there As a nutritionist and someone who has travelled throughout Europe I know what to expect from the average hotel breakfast The breakfast here was remarkable Plenty of fruit vegetables eggs and clean ingredients And there are also plenty of gluten free options available which I found to be rare in Vienna My breakfast at this hotel was the only decent gluten free meal I could find in Vienna ,0,115,1
 We have really enjoyed our four nights in the hotel As soon as we walked into reception we were greeted by cheerful and professional staff Our room 411 was even better than we expected The room was specious clean and bright The comfortable bed and quiet room enabled us to enjoy a restful night s sleep The hotel s location is ideal with a short walk to the main Wien Mitte transport hub with all the supermarkets eateries and services The centre of the shopping precinct and the famous Vienna landmarks are only a 10 minute walk away I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any of my family and friends ,0,115,1
 From the moment you get inside you know you are in the right place Our staying there was absolutely AMAZING The staff was so helpfull and trust me i needed them all the time beacuse i was traveling with my older parents and the fact that the sweetest receptionist named Diana called and looked up for us the best spot to get to see views without walking too much for my parents was so nice Everyone there always took care of us and made us feel like we were staying in a 5 stars hotel The fact it was so near to the beach and the mall was a bonus Huge thank you ,0,115,1
 My second times stayed in it has been 5 months since first time When my partner and I arrived we were told that we were accidently booked single bed room I was very worring because it was a long holiday weekend and we might not have any room to stay but the reception had solve it out I had to pay more 50 per night we stay 3 nights so it a fair price in this point We got a bigger room than last time The hotel was still make me feel like home Clean and smell good Staffs always very helpful I definately come back again if i was come to Amsterdam ,0,115,1
 I liked the hospitality right from the start and really it made me feel at home The staff seemed motivated and passionate about what they were doing and that is the measure of engagement of any customer industry so the credit also to go to the Arthur Christina for leading the team with high spirits Through out the stay I felt at ease and was given good care Being a HR person and a trainer I could see the genuineness of the smiles and the passion to serve customers Both Arthur Christina did not act as hosts but in fact did with professionalism and sincerity Friendliness and politeness was felt in the air ,0,115,1
 Absolute Luxury From the moment we arrived we we re welcomed with elegance the building speaks for itself but the staff and d cor make it all come to life You can see and feel all the extra touches and effort that has gone into this reputable establishment The staff helped at every and any request we had with warmness and a professional manner The bed was like sleeping on a cloud with extremely soft linen The room had everything we needed and more The pool spa and gym we re extremely impressive and well equipped I would be surprised if any other guests have a bad experience here We will be back ,0,115,1
 At first I was surprised by the room setting but the gadgets and the bed were really great and comfortable The fact that toilet was there in the room was a bit inconvenient because of the noise but the shower idea was good If you are going as a couple I think its fine I loved the room controls and the fact that you could also watch some movies that were not on TV Also the fact that you could change lights based on different moods was also interesting The tram stop is really close and you can take number 5 and it takes you to most tourit attractions museums and city centre ,0,115,1
 We had a lovely stay at this hotel which we chose for our honeymoon The staff are so friendly and helpful and it was a lovely surprise to find a bottle of prosecco in our room to congratulate us on our marriage The room service menu was well priced and we liked having croissants each day for breakfast and the hotel provides its guests with a free ipad to use during their stay which let us find out where to go in Amsterdam The bar is small but nice and does a great range of cocktails We thought it was a great hotel in a great location Couldn t really ask for more ,0,115,1
 From the shuttle pick up to the drop off by the shuttle at the airport we had a super stay at the Ramada We were able to check in early with a free upgrade room on the 11th floor with superb view of the city All the staff were very friendly and helpful The Ramada is situated about 10 minutes by tram from the heart of Amsterdam but the no 13 tram is just 2 minutes walking distance away and runs frequently We purchased a 48 hour pass at 12 50 per person and found this a very cheap way of getting round We would have no hesitation in recommending the Ramada Apollo ,0,115,1

 Early bird discounted bedroom was much smaller than expected No chair desk for sitting space but spacious cupboards traditional style woodwork and extremely comfortable beds I never slept so well in a hotel No noise from outside or inside The tram runs right outside the hotel so dispite it being north of the centre good for rest for strolling through a quieter part of town with the best gelato shop in the city just a quiet 10 min stroll away Panagetti Hotel staff extremely polite buffet breakfast vast and complete but boring after 3 days with no changes Coffee excellent as was just stopping in for a quick macchiato at the front door ,0,115,1

 Very near and on the same side of the river as the Eye and Lambeth Palace history buffs Also caught the water taxi from the eye to Greenwich Good buses near by some good pubs and restaurants Vauxhall tube station is about 3 blocks All in all a good choice This is more a business class hotel Food and drink were a bit pricey so we relied on other locations nearby There was a very cool pub directly across the street a converted small 3 deck boat that was very popular and from which you have great views of the eye Westminster and traffic on the river and it was very reasonable ,0,114,1
 The hotel is relatively new and as a result is immaculate where we saw including the public areas and the room There were some complimentary refreshments in the room which was a nice touch The bed was comfortable and as it was a king size it was very roomy The staff were very friendly both checking in and out and in the resteraunt for breakfast There was a very good selection for breakfast including good quality English breakfast and the usual cereals and pastries We had no issues and the hotel is well situated for both facilities and travel Shop right next door if you need any extras Very pleased all round ,0,114,1
 The Mercure Paris Termnu Nord is a very functional hotel with great value for money It is especially convenient for travellers who arrive or depart by train from the Gare de Nord as the station is bang opposite the hotel The room we stayed in was of a decent size with all the room amenities you would expect in a good hotel and also very clean The bed was very comfortable and even though the hotel is in a fairly busy area it was very quiet and we had a good night s rest There are a lot of cafes and good restaurants just outside the hotel so it was very convenient ,0,114,1
 Good choice of continental breakfast plenty of seating rare queues Though in the basement the room is air conditioned light and with an airy feel Public rooms and corridors are well proportioned and quiet The restaurant caters for most tastes and pockets The Bar is well stocked the wine list is adventurous and the wine well kept Bedrooms and bathrooms are spotless and generally well appointed The beds are comfortable yet supportive Given the general warmth of the building few guests should need more than the quilt provided Guests have self control of air conditioning and central heating Though window openings are restricted for safety reasons the available air flow is adequate ,0,114,1
 Second time I have used for business My room was really clean and well presented I was on the quiet side of the hotel so really lovely Facilities good nice pool not huge but there was no one else in when I went for early morning laps Also sauna and stream Breakfast offers really good selection They were busy good service when I first sat down I asked for fried eggs which are cooked to order which were a bit slow coming out Overall really good quality hotel close to central London and Chelsea Really nice to have Battersea Park just across the road great park really nice feature lots to see ,0,114,1
 Very nice staff I was traveling with my family two children 2 5 and Olivia from reception staff made a very nice check in We loved the design touch in the hotel decoration the bed is good Globally is a very nice hotel for family traveling with a great balance between price and quality The breakfast offer can be improved The ideia of having someone delivering at your suite a basket with bread croissant and chocolate bread is very good but something is missing maybe including fresh fruit but this did not affect our experience Suggestion to the staff continue to make an effort in hotel maintenance and people will love it ,0,114,1
 we love this hotel very much the location is superb the train station Gare De L est just located in front of this hotel we don t even have to cross the road as there is a tunnel which link directly to the train station there are so many shops and restaurants in the train station there are a few halal restaurants nearby which is walking distance from the hotel staff are very attentive polite and courteous the room is quite spacious and totally in love with their fabulous interior design the toilet is superb spacious and complete with hair dryer bed and pillows are extremely comfortable love this hotel very much ,0,114,1
 Full place was excellent and the Club Room was well worth the extra Nice continental breakfast and girl in Club Room very good Staff in the hotel were all very good and room was great Great idea having the free mobile in the room for use even though we didn t need The Jugged Hare was great for a drink at night and had very good Sunday lunch there We stayed over a weekend Friday to Monday and got an excellent deal due to the area being very quiet at weekends Having stayed in area before though we know the links around London are excellent and easy to anywhere from the hotel ,0,114,1
 It was my 2nd stay at the hotel and once again I had a great time there Staff is very friendly the room very nicely equipped with modern appliances and devices I had a really nice and clean room with a plenty of light and a nice small bathroom just big enough and I m not a small person I like this hotel also for its location There are multiple tube and bus stations around and even if there s a problem on any of the lines you can get there Also there are so many places to shop and get some food around that there is absolutely nothing to worry about ,0,114,1
 This was a great stay for us and our 2 year old The rooms were spacious and clean The staff was very friendly and helpful The breakfast was good and the garden behind the property was a very nice place to relax and play with our child It s about 10 minutes walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe which marks one end of Champs Elysees with all its shopping and dining options The hotel is also close to the metro though we were unable to utilize it as none of the metro entrances have disabled elevator access a bit shameful for Paris so taking our stroller in wasn t an option ,0,114,1
 The location of this hotel is what you are paying for and it is EXCELLENT You are a block from Musee D Orsay which means a block from the Metro and the hop on hop off buses and other public transport Cafes are nearby and it s easy to walk to all the major sites in that area So that s reason 1 to stay there The rest of the reasons are easy too friendly staff speaks a number of languages good bar and cafe on site rooms are small but creatively decorated and absolutely comfortable and cozy No amenity other than extra space is overlooked There is a small elevator lift ,0,114,1
 This hotel was very accommodating Upon arrival they offered us two different rooms one with a window facing the street and another one with a window facing the inside of the hotel which was very nice Since we went for New Years the desk helped us plan for the night with the traditional grapes and cava The room was very clean but my favorite was the bathroom We had a standup shower and a bath shower combo all in one bathroom The desk also helped us book a flamenco show hop on hop off bus and cab back to the airport Overall I would definitely return for the generosity of the staff ,0,114,1
 Fantastic hotel couldn t find fault with anything Staff friendly and approachable Hotel is within easy reach to Amsterdam Centraal via train or metro and around 20 mins to the airport also Very modern bright and upbeat hotel Spotless clean We had a fab view s from our room of the surroundings of the Ajax stadium Places to eat and bars within walking distance from the hotel as well as the train station no more the 5 8 mins walk The bar area with Dj in the evening and breakfast room on a Sunday with live band playing Jazz music was a nice touch Will definetly be returning and would highly recommend ,0,114,1

 Absolutely amazing loved the idea of it being a luxury apartment more than a hotel because of the higher level of privacy you get given The room was stunning could not fault it at all I even e mailed the staff a few days before our arrival to explain it was my partners birthday so could they wish him a happy birthday but they made the effort to decorate the bedroom with balloons banners rose petals and swan towels Simply sensational and my partner said it was the best birthday he had experienced Every enquiry we had the staff were eager to help and were welcoming during the whole of our stay ,0,114,1
 This was our 2nd stay at a H10 hotel and we weren t disappointed The staff were so professional hotel facilities were spotless and the location was super Our trip to Barcelona was to celebrate our 3rd anniversary and to our surprise the staff at the hotel had taken note of this On our first day we returned to our room having spent the afternoon at the hotels lovely rooftop terrace only to be welcomed by a congratulations card and bottle of bubbly Having worked within the hotel industry i know it is the little touches and the attention to detail that makes a hotel stand out and this hotel certainly does ,0,114,1
 You never know what you are going to get with a Best Western but we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel It is only 5 minutes walk from the main train station It dosn t look like much from the outside but inside it was very nice The reception staff were exceptionally warm and friendly They kept giving my young daughters sweets when we left my youngest gave one of them a hug which was very touching The room was very large and well equipped The breakfast was also excellent I thought it was very reasonably priced for the centre of Milan We would recommend staying here if you are visiting Milan ,0,114,1

 Great place for a weekend From the moment you walk into the lobby you feel right at home If your home is a very hip and stylish place where bikes and LPs are decoratively hanging on and off walls of course The staff is very friendly attentive and helpful be it at the reception or in the bar The rooms are small but cosy and come with a decent selection of records to play on your very own record player Bonus points for the Twin Shadows album It s surprisingly quiet in the rooms considering the buzzing energy of the neighborhood in the downstairs bar at times particularly on weekend nights ,0,113,1
 In the middle of the gorgeous lobby of the Bloomsbury we ended our stay with high tea The scones were literally melt in your mouth delicious the best I have ever tasted Pure heaven We will be back The staff were at our beck and call when does that happen anymore at any hotel I couldn t believe how helpful and caring they were it was hard to end our vacation here They treated our kids to milk and cookies every night presented them with stockings filled with candy and gifts at Christmas and made sure we knew where we were going every day as we explored London Terrific and tremendous ,0,113,1
 Excellent location We walked to every attraction we wanted Eiffel Tower Arc De Triomphe Pantheon Notre Dame Crypts Louvre and enjoyed the shopping along the way Easy metro access we just chose not to use it in favor of exploring above ground The facilities met expectations stayed in the junior suite Room had a nice view along the street with little noise Bathroom was large and modern Staff was friendly and helpful worth buying tickets from the front desk for a couple extra Euro than standing in lines at attractions Smart phone was provided for the stay which was super useful for looking up restaurants and just navigating via google maps ,0,113,1

 The incredible coziness of this hotel was made all the more great by the friendliness generosity of the staff always being greeted with a warm smile as soon as you walked through the door The hotel is in an amazing location but tucked just far enough away it s honestly a hidden gem The overall d cor of the hotel was simple but with the perfect balance of lush touches The room was perfect for a couple with the best view the hotel could offer which was perfect when drinking espressos made in the room eating chocolates that were provided Overall it was a wonderful stay we will definitely return again ,0,113,1
 Excellent hotel From the kindness of all the Doormen to the very friendly and efficient Reception team I cannot fault this wonderful hotel On a street opposite the Natural History Museum and 5mins from South Kensington tube station Very positive and upbeat style and interior design Perhaps a trendier funky style and artworks than say Malmaison but with similar modern high standards and quality Room was marvellous with balcony wonderful mattress bath and shower underfloor heating air con wifi Samsung smart tv yes all the best amenities Housekeeping was brilliant and we never saw them but such a perfect job This is a very very excellent hotel Give it a go ,0,113,1

 Absolutely LOVED my stay here I m from the UK and took my husband away for a surprise weekend in Amsterdam the room was so big the beds were really comfortable my husband wanted to know what kind of pillows they had as he even wanted to buy his own Were a young couple aged 25 27 it was in a great location as the hotel was a short walk from a tram stop which took you into city center with the help of google maps we got around incredibly easily with a 24 hour tram pass bought from the hotel we were able to get around the city with ease ,0,113,1
 The room bathroom were marvellous fully equipped modern interior etc Also large garage with lots of parking spots and with enough space for most cars Perfect for everyone who travels with his car The staff is very friendly and polite and they really like to help you The only downside to the hotel is its location it is far outside the center and because there is no tram shortly after midnight you have to take the expensive taxi because driving around with your own car around Amsterdam is the horror and parking is 5 EUR per hour Since you know that before booking I won t add this to the cons ,0,113,1
 I was very happy and would go again The staff are so pleasant and I took my husband for his birthday and I didn t have a good view so they gave us another room and it brought a smile on birthday boy 8 floor and the views were amazing This is what I call customer service Brilliant Also brought a cake to our room Thank you so much and I will bd coming back The train were close by and the evening walk by riverside perfect Must do the cable car that was fab Loved everything about the 2 days I spent at yr hotel I give it 5 star ,0,113,1

 We spent the Christmas eve at the 25 Hours Hotel We had a great time We lived in Vienna but wanted to do something different on that date I loved the colorful room and the modern and confortable bathroom Specially good was the service at the bar and restaurant The ambiance was really festive The terrace was open so we could go out and enjoy the view of Vienna and fresh air between drinks since it was not that cold we had been there many times in Summer which is very much recommendable We also liked very much the breakfast the next day There was plenty of options all very tasty ,0,113,1
 Clean nice and super safe hotel with really professional and helpful staff in great location in Barcelona Within walking distance to the gothic old town and the beach but in a slightly quieter neighborhood I loved everything about this hotel My friend had her purse pick pocketed in a nightclub one of the nights and the hotel staff was really helpful in trying to help her contact the nightclub to see if they had found it My room was relatively small but had a nice comfy bed good standard and comfort in general and was very clean An oasis to come back to after a day or night out in Barcelona ,0,113,1

 We stayed here as my daughter is living in Paris this year and it is near her apartment in the 7th I know Paris well and from here it is easy to walk to lots of famous monuments and galleries The rooms are comfortable especially the beds and there are rooms with walk in showers The most important thing though was that the staff were so friendly and chatty which dare I say is not always the case in Paris hotels They could not have been more helpful Tip I set up an uber account on my phone as I had my elderly mother with me and this proved invaluable ,0,112,1
 Apart from the fact that the hotel was excellent and that we had the most wonderful stay here plus an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower from our balcony I was delighted with the fact that at booking I was asked if it was a special occasion which it was my sister s 40th birthday I hadn t expected that they would do anything but in fact on arrival they wished my sister a very happy birthday and we received chocolates and free cocktails All staff were incredibly helpful and polite and our room was spacious and comfortable I would certainly return given the chance and would highly recommend it ,0,112,1

 Beautiful peaceful setting in a typical London Regency square The hotel is in a set of Regency town houses each with a separate front door The rooms are beautiful and I had a lovely room overlooking the square If you have mobility problems make sure you let the hotel know when booking as there are no lifts but don t worry about carrying your baggage the staff on reception couldn t be more helpful There is a choice of breakfast location either full English across the road where you can also dine or a lovely continental breakfast in the basement of the main building the pastries are superb Great stay ,0,112,1

 The hotel is very centrally located as it is close to many of the the main attractions Rooms are a good size and nicely decorated Beds are very comfortable which is always an important factor for us The staff are very pleasant and extremely accomodating Unfortunately our stay was very brief as we were travelling to and from Greece which meant we were only in London for 3 nights Upon our return from Greece we were upgraded to a two bedroom apartment in the neighbouring Taj51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Apartments which was fabulous I can t fault the hotel and will definitely stay there again when next visiting London ,0,112,1
 Loved the decor one of the main reasons for choosing the hotel The service was great friendly welcoming staff who did their best to please and to accommodate requests We had 2 rooms on the 2nd floor and they had lovely high ceilings The breakfast is really good for a small hotel Echire butter good jams cold cuts neatly cut and arranged good tea selection hot milk a different fresh tart each day all quite refined The complimentary tea coffee and tart in the afternoon was a real plus Small details make the difference Wifi is fast and no need to re sign in throughout the stay which is great ,0,112,1

 staff were very friendly and always willing to help Beds were super comfortable and the double room we booked was a very good size location is perfect set on the side of of a lovely canal close to everything nearby but still chilled and peaceful The all inclusive thing is all well and good but it s hard to spend much time in the hotel when you re in Amsterdam so never really made the most of it although it s nice to be able to arrive back to the hotel and have a few nightcap drinks for free rather than pay 10euros each Great hotel would love to go back,0,112,1

 Nice modern clean hotel in a good location for transport and local amenities We were upgraded to an Executive room which was spacious There was an option to pay an extra 25 Euros for use of the mini bar which we declined to take Staff were friendly and spoke good English which was useful as our German language skills failed us sometimes U3 line is about 5 minutes walk away and the Westbahnhof is a little further in the opposite direction from the U Bahn The area has many shops and restaurants nearby too on Mariahilfer Strasse and there is a useful supermarket on the same street as the hotel ,0,112,1

 The staff were very helpful I had travelled to the hotel for work and this was booked through my company with the weekend covered through Booking com When I checked in the staff couldn t have been more helpful to make sure we had the same room for the whole duration of our trip and also made sure my wife could access the room the following day when she arrived During our stay I was recovering from leg surgery and the staff couldn t have been more helpful in assisting us The breakfast was great and the location was perfect for exploring all the normal locations in Paris ,0,110,1
 We had an amazing stay at this hotel We checked in late and had booked an executive room only to be told we had been upgraded to the honeymoon suite This completely helped to make our already amazing trip to London even more memorable Thank you so much to the lovely staff The room was amazing and we will definitely stay here again if we visit London again Only downside was the breakfast we pre booked was only continental and a further cost was needed for a hot breakfast which we knew nothing of until we arrived for breakfast Other than that we could not fault the hotel ,0,110,1
 We loved our room Good size room by Paris standards We had a quiet interior room The bed was very comfortable The bathroom was perfect for one person and a bit tight for two but perfectly appointed with a tub and a window One big perk was use of a smartphone during our stay for FREE calls to the United States and within Europe Concierge service was friendly and efficient We loved walking around the area of the hotel Lively cafes excellent coffee at Malongo and delicious food at KGB Conveniently located near Notre Dame and the Louvre We will stay here again next time we visit Paris ,0,110,1

 We have stayed here before and love it we had a corner room with a view of the courtyard which was lovely comfy bed and spacious bathroom as well We ate in the Kona restaurant on the first night of our stay and it was nice although there were only two tables occupied so a little low in atmosphere We love this location as it is quiet but very easy to walk to Piccadilly Covent Garden etc Also easy to get cabs we went to a concert in Brixton and got a cab there which was great The staff are very helpful we will definitely stay here again ,0,110,1
 We had a little studio with a full bed and bed sofa The bed sofa was very comfortable and even two adults could sleep there well The room was newly renovated well equipped and quite spacious for such a location in Paris The place is in a business area where it is quiet in the evenings and weekends but champs elysees is just 5 min away so you have all types of restaurants and shops you need Take the breakfast service if you want some croissants during the weekend or need to leave early The nearby bakery was closed weekends and the little supermarkets only opened at 8 30,0,110,1

 This is a return visit Sydney House has to be the very best boutique hotel in London and indeed beyond We have returned here a couple of times even extended our stay and there is a reason for that Quality of staff quality of service professionalism and simply it is a high quality townhouse hotel that manages to create a home from home atmosphere Our work in music involves various hours so we often come and go at different times of the day and this was never an issue We have stayed in many hotels and certainly Sydney House can hold its place with the best five star ,0,110,1
 Ok I probably have high expectations and after a few years multiple stays in this hotel it s beginning to look a little tired round the edges That said I would still highly rate this place Booked in advance you can get a really good rate for a superior room with an amazing balcony in the centre of Barcelona The room was clean and quiet with a very comfortable bed Breakfast was above average for the price of the room If you like weight training fitness the gym in the basement is outstanding for any hotel We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the Axel hotel to friends ,0,110,1
 Whilst the hotel is lovely and conveniently located next to the Clot metro station which is on the main line we booked the hotel as it was advertised as a spa hotel When we checked in we weren t told to book into the spa and just to pop down When we did we found that there is only space for 6 people in the spa as there are only 6 loungers So we didn t get a chance to use it which was disappointing as was one of the main reasons for booking The room was also very small and you couldn t walk around the bed ,0,110,1
 Perfect location in El Born that is like Gamla Stan in Sweden in atmosphere Plenty of Tapas restaurants around and a 30 min walk distance to the beach The hotel is very nice with a rooftop pool with a lovely view over El Born We didn t try the hotel breakfast there s plenty of cheaper and perhaps better as in authentic alternatives on your way to the beach Picnic is one of them with the chose of the serrano ham scramble eggs and american pancakes for 9 are a strong contender to any breakfast Nice AC at a stable 19 degrees celsius The hotel is strongly recommended ,0,110,1
 Fantastic breakfast selection I would recommend including breakfast as a package deal otherwise it is quite expensive although worth it We stayed in a standard room The bed was the biggest bed I have ever seen and the matteress and pillows were both very comfortable a bit on the hard side Bathroom was quite luxurious The TV selection wasn t as good as we have seen in other hotels for English speaking but then again you re in Barcelona and probably won t want to be in your room much anyway Staff were friendly enough and willing to help Great location Would definitely stay in this hotel again ,0,110,1
 Housekeeping needs to be improved I m allergic to dust On the 3rd day I developed hives There was a feather beside the bed on the floor that was there for 3 days withouth moving Easily seen and would have disappeared if simple vacuuming was done Tested with a small piece of plastic beside the bed which also remained after the cleaning lovely hotel otherwise with really lovely friendly helpful staff They did change the bedsheets and clean properly after I called Housekeeping though The toilet door got stuck and locked by itself and looking a the scratch marks on the lock this was not the first time ,0,110,1
 The Premier Best Western Kaiserhof surpassed my expectations I had read the excellent reviews and as a result booked the property The excellent reviews do not do the hotel justice Staff was helpful professional and friendly The room was exceptional with anything available to you if you did not bring it with you Beds and pillows were very comfortable the bathroom was nice and big with a bath and shower The location was excellent as well with free parking on the week end Last but certainly not least the breakfast was outstanding I have stayed in many four star facilities in Austria and this one is the BEST ,0,110,1
 The staff were very helpful and quick assisted us straight away every time we asked for room service We asked for something to put flowers into and they came straight away with a tall glass and scissors to cut the stems As we checked in they recognised us from a previous stay and that just shows how much attention they pay towards their guests And to top it off we got 40 minutes late when checking out and when we came to pay they told us not to worry about it as they would give it complimentary We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others ,0,110,1
 Had a wonderful stay David at reception was so very helpful and friendly a great asset to the hotel We stayed in one of the privilege rooms which was very nice and comfortable Loved the coffee machine in the room which was spotlessly clean The hotel is on a small side street so is nice and quiet but it is within walking distance of everything Close to public transport also which we used to get to and from the airport The breakfast was great lots to choose from to set you up for the day Would definitely stay here again if we are back in this beautiful city ,0,110,1

 Loved the fact that they had an indoor smoking area Saved us going outdoors in the cold The staff were absolutely brilliant and helped us with any questions and always greeted us in the morning and night time Seen a lot of reviews about the location but we thought the location was beautiful and even if it is a fair distance from the centre it states this when booking and plus there are trams to take you to the centre so it wasn t a problem for us The room was exactly how it was pictured Stunning rooms and very comfy beds Always cleaned and was completely spotless ,0,110,1
 My third time staying at The Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre The only place i stay when taking short trips to Amsterdam Shuttle bus service from Schiphol Airport every 30 mins Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful Floor 17 Sky Bar is a added bonus to the hotel with panoramic views over Amsterdam Tram stop is right outside the hotel Anne Franks house is 5 mins away by tram then Central Station is 10 mins away The Ramada is a very modern and elegant property best suited for couples wanting to get away for a couple of days im counting down the days till my next visit ,0,110,1

 This hotel was super clean and efficient I d like to have had coffee making facilities in the room or downstairs free of charge considering the room rate I think breakfast should be in the room rate then encouraging guests to use the ground floor facilities in the foyer etc a little more I wasn t quite sure if the bar downstairs was for guests to use or not It would have been nice for this to be a little more enticing to sit at the end of a night out or have a drink before going out All in all location room staff were very good ,0,109,1
 After I conveyed my initial disappointment that we were not given a twin room though we had indicated this in our booking n request this was promptly rectified by the manager Juan He quickly searched for a twin room and when none was available offered to upgrade us to a deluxe twin room throughout our stay Another room that had a strong smell of smoke tho a none smoking room was quickly switched to another area that was quieter had a better room configuration n without the smell of smoke I was very impressed by his service and proactive approach to ensuring guest satisfaction Great job Juan ,0,109,1
 Lovely hotel great location beside the underground Love the warm cookie on arrival as we were hungry breakfast was ok My partner had a fry which he said wasn t great I had the porridge which was terrible But loved the fresh fruit and pastries The bar on level 12 is beautiful with great views but didn t enjoy it as it took us 25mins to get a drink and it was not that busy We had to watch the barmen show off for an unnecessarily long period of time while they made cocktails Would not go back to the bar again as a result of this ,0,109,1
 Antoine on the staff as well as the concierge were absolutely fantastic I discovered JUST as I arrived that I d had my wallet stolen Antoine especially went above and beyond to help me sort myself out I got the impression that they really wanted to take care of me after such a scary thing Losing everything in a strange city can be absolutely horrible but despite it I had a wonderful overnight at the Melia Vendome Thanks for all the help The hotel itself is lovely and in a very nice part of town You fall out of bed and you re in place de Concorde ,0,109,1

 We picked this hotel because we rented a car for a three week road trip from Amsterdam to Vienna and they have parking on site and it is only two blocks from the train bus station for easier access to locations in Amsterdam The room was clean comfortable and secure It was either new or completely remodeled It has a small bar with ice and a moderate restaurant Breakfast buffet is good but 12 50 EU A couple of mornings we just took the public transit to the main train station and ate a hearty English breakfast a block away to start our adventures for the day ,0,109,1

 I booked this hotel thanks to its fantastic location right next to Dam Square We had a lovely time here the rooms were very comfortable and very reasonably priced The rooms even came with a pillow menu incase you didn t like the ones provided The hotel and staff were exceptionally good to us letting us check in early and leave our bags with them after check out on the last day The final lovely touch was them sending a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room as it was my Birthday that day I have absolutly nothing negative to say about my experience at this hotel ,0,109,1
 Everything was just great The high quality service for this price seems a perfect ratio Nice big bathroom with a window very clean stuff is friendly always ready to help and multilingual nice breakfast fast WIFI Vending machine in the lobby where I could get some snacks was a good advantage I was a bit worrying because of the late check in as the front desk works till six but everything went smoothly with a keybox Also great location in the centre everything is within a walking distance Definitely will stay there again when coming to Vienna Thank you for making my stay in Vienna so comfy ,0,109,1
 The staff was exceptional Small but comfortable room Outstanding location I would highly recommend but be aware of 2 things 1 we needed to arrange private transfer as the taxi s don t want to or can t navigate the small roads It with a private transfer through the hotel they were able to connect with the hotel and meet us at the bottom of the hill with luggage cart the concierges were outstanding and coordinated everything perfectly 2 the rooms are very dark poor lighting But honestly the staff service beautiful in room extras robe slippers etc for this small hotel far surpass any brand name ,0,109,1
 The onsite restaurant was very convenient and provided good value for meals when you just don t feel like going out anymore There weren t very many other choices in the vicinity so the option of having a good meal in a clean and contemporary setting was nice to have Each table had an outlet so can plug in with USB outlets as well charge your phones and stay connected Free wifi was great The Bijlmer Arena train station which is one of the major hubs in Amsterdam is an easy 5 7 min walk from the hotel and an Esprit outlet was right outside the station ,0,109,1
 From the moment we walked through the door we were met with a smile and professionalism This was also the very first time in our lives and we do travel that we had an orientation of the hotel and all of the extras in our suite That really comes in handy for so many things The lighting could be a tad better in the bathroom for us gals doing our makeup No problem as I simply used the main area mirror The cool oval sit in windows were so unique as was the style and artsy look of the unit We luuuuved it Would definitely go back ,0,109,1

 We have stayed in the hotel for only 1 night because we had an early flight from London City airport With the taxi it was only 5 minutes to the airport Hotel is very modern bed was really good and the shower as well If you visit London for leisure purposes it is not the best location although the train will bring you quite fast to the city center but it is not a vibrant area Staff is great very nice and pro active I like the atmosphere and I believe it is much better when staff is dressed like in this hotel informal but still representative ,0,109,1
 It was a nice place we enjoyed the bath was very relaxing We liked the concept The location is great if u book hop on hop off they will let you in front if the hotel green line number 16 and orange one number 19 It was a bit smelly on the corridor because of the vacuum the cleaner forgot to clean the bath also she forgot to supply us with coffee and milk but as soon I call the reception in less than 5 minutes we had coffee and milk I love the location and the room Also the price was good We like this place ,0,109,1
 The location of the hotel was perfect just across the street from the Milan central station and few steps from the Metro 30 minutes walk from the shopping areas and city center hotel is clean comfortable and the buffet breakfast and dinner were excellent with lot of choices and the speed in refilling the buffet was amazing We got a junior suite with a perfect view of the station and the street the staff were amazing helpful and smiling even though we got an electricity problem but the staff was so quick in responding and fixing it even at 3 in the morning i definetly recommend Glam Hotel,0,109,1
 This is an extremely modern and luxurious hotel We were given an upgrade to two suites that were both spectacular because they didn t have connecting rooms Ok Thank you They did everything in their power to make us comfortable from the afternoon snacks turn down service and all staff The bathrooms might be the most spectacular I have seen with every modern convince I look very forward to my return The linens and towels were also amazing We had room service and the food was extremely good and plentiful It was also the price of local restaurants so we did not feel they overpriced the food ,0,109,1
 Big bathroom with his and hers sinks and a bath big enough for two also the bed was very comfy Great location close to the station it was raining when we arrived by we were greeted by one of the hotel porters holding an umbrella Great service and complimentary minibar is very nice touch The wellness centre is bigger than anticipated with a nice jacuzzi for a long soak after the long day walking all around But it s all the small touches that set this hotel apart from other like the free maps the turndown service the minibar the umbrellas the bathroom toiletries and many more ,0,109,1

 The decor was so charming in every room Each room has a different theme color but both of ours both the adults and teens had separate rooms were impeccable clean and fresh No mildew smell no worries about old dusty or dirty carpet pillows or bedspreads Windows open to let in the fresh air We faced a street not canal and thought we weren t missing a thing The staff was friendly and helpful On sight breakfast was very convenient and tasty Rooms and bath were well appointed and fairly roomy for a boutique European hotel Would definitely go back It added to the charm of Amsterdam ,0,109,1
 Elegant property in a really convenient location but on a quiet street Entry is through a nondescript entrance with a small name plate on the wall that is easily missed but leads on to a shared stylish courtyard space Our family room was a really good size with stair up to an additional single bed on a loft landing space In room kitchen facilities handy though we didn t use much Very nice toiletries The buffet breakfast is really superior quality with very fresh ingredients focaccia bread divine and the freshly made coffee from the barista machine is excellent We would definitely stay at Camperio house again ,0,109,1
 The professional and friendly service by all staff is top notch The breakfast is probably the most plentiful I have ever seen at a mid sized hotel The hotel bar happy hour is very nice and Max the bartender is wonderful and gave us a great nearby restaurant suggestion Our room was clean comfortable and spacious by European standards with a huge marble bathroom The hotel is very close but not too close to the Central train station and walking there with rolling luggage was no problem maybe 5 minutes Very close to the Metro to easily get around all of Milan Fantastic Wi Fi Great value ,0,109,1

 Very friendly and helpful staff Travelling with a 7 year old so all the little things like greeting her with a little bag of sweets a gift pack in the room and her own set of toiletries made our stay very memorable We also arrived very late so the kitchen was closed but when I asked where I could walk to get some chips for her as she was hungry and had looked forward to having that when we got to London the cook fired up the fryer and made her a nice portion Definately a hotel that goes the extra mile ,0,104,1
 We loved our stay in Casa Bonay from the first Minute All the staff we met were exceptionally friendly our room was beautiful with a view over Barcelona roofs and the sun shining onto our bed in the morning The Hotel bar is incredibly classy with an amazing choice of beers and very comfortable Sofas They even have their own brand of Soap and Shampoos which smell delicious the hair dryer was very powerful It is only a couple of meters from the Metro and in Walking distance from the beach the centre and the Gaudi house I would come back anytime ,0,104,1
 the location is the selling point this is my 5th return no membership all in change staff undertrained paperwork too much wanted to extend my stay had to do online then get to the reception only hours later to find again not registered main issue this time was cleanliness the carpet was not deep cleaned for months old hair etc the sheets changed once a week the quality of food purchases terribly low I thought i was eating rubber not cheese or eggs tasteless Marginally better in the exec lounge that closes completely serving at 8 30 pm unacceptable in central london ,0,104,1

 Great weekend in London and the icing on the cake was the hotel and staff Location was fantastic for the Tower of London and we could see London Bridge from our room Room was very clean lovely facilities bath and separate shower Free wifi water etc and everything was refreshed on our second day It was the little touches and attention to the detail that makes a difference which some hotels lack At London prices we thought the room was great value for money We are in the hospitality trade and have taken away a few great ideas PS Love the Duck ,0,104,1

 The experience of staying at UNA was just fantastic The stuff were extremely helpful the room was stylish clean and comfortable the breakast was sufficient and varied We also got the room on a higher floor with a nice view overlooking the city and a double bed all the things we specified as desirable prerequisites in our booking The hotel is also close to a train metro station which is very convinient The only thing is that it might be diffucult to fnd the entrance once you arrive late so it s better to familiarize yourself with direction prior to the arrival ,0,104,1
 After running around all day returning to the hotel was easy and for each day we were in time for happy hour very enjoyable lounge drinks and food plus a big courtyard for those that wanted fresh air The hotel staff was extremely helpful in guiding us to all tourist spots and local restaurants We had dinner in the hotel one evening and it was outstanding Plus a terrific breakfast to start the day Thanks for taking care of us our raves about this beautiful hotel will continue for a long time The photos on the website are very accurate Thanks again ,0,104,1
 We were moved into the Grange Hotel Suites which were around the corner from the hotel This wasn t a problem for us and the weather was so nice that a brief 1 minute walk to the main hotel was fine to go and get breakfast they had included this free of charge because we were in the suites The bed was very hard but perhaps some people would prefer that Breakfast had a good buffet selection and the location is perfect The roof terrace on the 7th floor gives you a great view of St Paul s and The Shard ,0,103,1
 I spoke to three or four different staff at the reception during our stay but all of them were really very friendly We asked some questions about a VIP pass to Versailles the hotel sells at the reception and the staff didn t know the answer but we weren t too disappointed about that because he really tried to help us Also we lost hot water for few hours one night but we could see the staff again was really trying to help and it was fixed the next morning as he promised Customer service was just excellent at this hotel ,0,103,1
 We stayed at the Mecure Bloomsbury for a single night Check in out was seamless We had erroneously booked a double room instead of a twin The reception staff member was exceptionally helpful in accommodating our change in room request although understandably noted that this would not always be possible Our room was clean with contemporary decor and excellent facilities While a little on the small side the room still provided excellent value for price paid All staff were very friendly We highly recommend the breakfast buffet where no expense is spared to diners We will definitely use the Mecure again ,0,103,1
 The staff was always accommodating and helpful whether we needed help with a reservation or an extra for our room They were patient with our rudimentary French and always willing to speak with us in English When hailing a cab for us they always made sure we could communicate our destination to the driver The room was beautiful and the bed and pillow the most comfortable we have ever had in a hotel The location was wonderful just a few steps from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs de Elysses and just a short cab ride to many of Paris landmarks ,0,103,1
 The location was great a few minutes walk from Oxford Circus tube An M S nearby as well as the Berwick St market for street food One of our party is vegan and we found all sorts of places nearby serving vegan food a real bonus Shopping on the doorstep Liberty across the street A real social vibe in the area and you can walk along Regent St to arrive at Piccadilly Circus and onto Leicester Square Convenient to theatres too the Palladium is around the corner from the hotel We would definitely use the hotel again when staying in London ,0,103,1

 Very convenient to the Gare du Nord so we could access the Eurostar and Metro easily Check in was handled well and we found all staff to be excellent Lovely breakfast plenty of choice and a nice view of the classic station building opposite Other meals need to be found outside the hotel but you are really spoilt for choice with so many nearby cafes and restaurants Room was comfortable and clean We had the choice of an inside view quiet or a Paris at night view not so quiet maybe We chose the quiet room and never heard a sound ,0,103,1
 The fact we got upgraded because our room wasn t ready and we needed to get ready and go out ASAP was lovely I literally couldn t fault anything apart from there wasn t a toilet brush in the room But the hotel was amazing if I was going to the O2 again I would not hesitate to stay here again staying at another hotel would never cross my mind And what can I say about the breakfast so much option so tasty and I would return just to have breakfast Thank you for an amazing stay really made our weekend ,0,103,1
 Yes the room was small but adequate for our needs we were only staying one night and as it was a short walk to Hyde Park and nearest tube station Lancaster Gate it was fine The staff were very good 24 hr on call if you needed anything They also had a free Mobile phone for your use in the room Tea Coffee in room Microwave Iron board safe Mini bar and all toiletries in Bathroom The location was near to the Winter Wonderland Event in Hyde Park which we were visiting and taking in a show in the West End ,0,103,1

 The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe on a direct bus route from the airport The hotel is undergoing renovations but don t let that put you off The staff have organised facilities so that the impact is minimal The newly refurbished rooms are bright modern very comfortable to stay in With great friendly staff the overall hotel experience is very good Fair play to the staff who are going out of their way to help through all the works Lovely hotel with friendly staff in a great location I ll be back ,0,103,1
 I loved it here I was stuck with two bad ankles and was really unwell the staff were so helpful and kind to me and went above and beyond to ensure I was ok One staff member found me crutches the other offered to book me in the single room for another night at a reduced rate so I could recover I literally couldn t move they also asked me how I was feeling the next day and brought me up some scones and tea It s really heartening to know that great service and genuine kindness exists and thrives here ,0,103,1
 Very accessible and within a 20 minute walk to the Louvre Close to the metro as well so it s very easy to see the major sights in Paris The staff were very friendly and accommodating both check in and check out were hassle free and the pre arrival survey was also really helpful The breakfast which came with our room was very traditionally French a variety of breads jams butter and yogurt it was the perfect way to start the day The room was very comfortable and clean with a spacious bathroom and all amenities We had a great stay ,0,103,1
 Great location that was super easy to get to We picked this spot because of its closeness to Paddington station where the express Heathrow shuttle arrives but the location is a great launching point to reach Hyde Park Kensington Palace Royal Albert Hall etc and a short distance by cab to Parliament Westminster Abbey or Buckingham Palace Paddington is also a subway line right to Piccadilly Circus So it was a nice clean boutique hotel but we weren t interested in the amenities we were interested in it being a good launch pad at a reasonable price It fit the bill ,0,103,1
 The room was a fair size and the bed very comfortable Stayed here this time last year for Ride London Aircon very effective and opening windows if preferred Fridge complimentary water good toiletries good free wifi secure parking on site first come first served Didn t use TV but Sky box attached Was allowed to check in early as room was ready Helpful friendly staff Very good value for a London hotel Easy to get into London bus stops almost outside and trains 15 20 mins walk On a busy main road into London but this didn t affect my sleep ,0,103,1
 Breakfast is always great The rooms are comfortable and this time I stayed at the front of the hotel which was much better Some rooms seem small but I guess that s London The location is good and staff always found a taxi for me when needed The gym is small but ok for a short trip I like the idea of the grab and go breakfast when you need to leave early although opening the dining room a little earlier would help I had room service which was also good For a business trip I can t really fault it ,0,103,1
 Very nice hotel located only 5 mins walk away from Icaria Beach The bus stop is right outside the hotel which makes it very convenient to move around in Barcelona The staff was friendly The room size was big and it was sparkling clean We stayed for 5 nights and there was no trouble at all Hotel arranged an airport shuttle for 2 of us and charged only 18 euros which was pretty awesome as the airport is quite far There are few happening night clubs about 10 mins walk away and nightlife is awesome I will definitely stay here again ,0,103,1

 Absolutely oozing with style and character The hotel s location is central and Sagrada Famille is a short and scenic walk away Our room was smaller than we expected but perfectly formed My friend and I loved the terraces and utilised both of them during our stay Cotton House staff are warm and accommodating Our stay was to celebrate my birthday so we wanted something with the x factor and this hotel certainly delivers We especially want to thank Alonso Gabriel Sara Laura Mercure Younes and Alejandro who were exceptionally sweet to us and ensured our trip was extra special Gracias ,0,103,1

 I definitely liked this hotel and will recommend it to everyone who wants to combine a city break with relaxation and pampering Although the treatments in the spa were not the best I have had in a hotel spa in was still relaxing as well as the pool and sundeck on the roof The staff was very helpful and friendly but the cleaning of the room was not always timely and they forgot to fill the minibar but all that was fixed immediately when I mentioned about it My overall view is that Hotel 1898 is a good choice in Barcelona ,0,103,1
 We reserved it because of air conditioning it was 37 C in Vienna Its performance was not ovewhelming but it was not hot in the room Bearing in mind the price location and temeprature outside it was decent Location is both very close to the highway knote landstrasse and not too far from the centre We were passing thought Vienna and managed to make two sightseeing trips at night and in the morning and had a good night s sleep in between in spite of the heat No problem with parking a car free outside the hotel but it was weekend ,0,103,1
 I was travelling with my 10 year old daughter so location safety and facilities were very important to me And I have to say I was not disappointed It is centrally located near Dam Square and has easily accessible transit tram buses that lead to all the touristy spots It is easy to get to from the airport as well The rooms are cleverly layed out maximising space and very clean The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful The area is very nice and I felt safe walking around with my daughter I would highly recommend this hotel to all ,0,103,1

 Wow loved this hotel So close to absolutely everything It s clean got everything you need has a touch of the old fashioned touch class staff are lovely breakfast is amazing Very impressed I will return It s walking distance from most things the hop on off bus stops right across the rd which is handy plus all the river cruises are a 2 min walk away There is a supermarket bila right next door plenty of food shops on the street or across the river 3min walk Good value for money good price considering how close to everything it was ,0,103,1
 I loved the roof top bar I did not try the little pool but people were sunbathing and enjoying the sun It is a great place for lunch or a drink The breakfast room was quiet and the service was good It was my birthday and they brought me a surprise sparkling wine and cake so the staff takes notice of things like that Via Laietana is a noisy busy street but close to shopping restaurants metro stations etc I would book a room on a higher floor preferably facing from Laietana if possible The terraza upgrade is worth the money ,0,103,1
 If you are travelling to Milan this is the place to stay A comfortable and affordable 4 star hotel just a one minute walk to the subway and a 10 minute walk to one of the main shopping districts Marghera They are dog friendly and they provide parking so you can leave your car and visit Milan on foot The immediate area offers small shops and street food Breakfast at the hotel was wonderful a full buffet with flaky croissants excellent selection of coldcuts and cheese and scrambled eggs and bacon Very highly recommend the Antares Rubens for anyone visiting Milan ,0,103,1
 Great location Very easy to get to any place the metro staion Bignami is just infront of the hotel Great staff and hotel rooms We stayed a total 8 days 7 nights breakfast included Worth every penny You realy don t need an expensive hotel in the center of Milan when you got Starhotel We where on christmas and new year so know that 80 of the restaurants in Milan are closed especially pizzerias but everything eles works about the same My advice is to call a restaurant via youre hotel to make sure they are realy open tripadviser is missleading ,0,103,1
 warm welcome from staff on reception and throughout entire stay always willing to talk to guests and assist in anyway they could a credit to the hotel Location was perfect close to central station 5 min and a short stroll to the nearest metro stop Venezia which makes getting round Milan a lot easier although you could walk to the centre Duomo in 15 minutes Would stay at this hotel again and would certainly recommend The only slight negative I can give on the hotel is the size of the shower which was rather small but that s being really picky ,0,103,1
 The facilities were fab the spa was open until 11pm which is great when you have been on your feet all day Although it is small so if it was busy then that would of been a issue and more lighting should be thought about especially by the stairs to the whirlpool as they are not lit at all and sign for the step into the steam room Rubber mats should also be considered for the floor when wet as very slippery Could not complain about the room very comfortable and excellent size Would return Helpful staff 15mins from the city centre,0,103,1
 i went there with my family and friends 11 people in total for the weekend for the fc barcelona match and also for sighseeing the hotel was close by everything and the services were amazing the rooms are clean and comfy the space you had in each room was more than enough you have a supermarket just infront of the hotel and also a pharmacy you have a small restuarant infront of the hotel who was very cheap but delicious all in all i will deffinitly return to this hotel if i ever get the chance to go back to Barcelona ,0,103,1

 The apartments are new and very clean The whole place has a modern feel to it All of the staff were very courteous and helpful but Almena was a star so friendly and personable I like the very large spaces downstairs comfortable and peaceful The breakfast was very good no bacon though and represents excellent value whilst reading the free newspapers Free tea and coffee 24 hours is also a lovely and unique touch Having a pantry of essentials is also a good idea My only small gripe would be the lack of natural light in my particular room 415 ,0,102,1
 The Hotel is in a perfect location Less than 30 seconds to Aldgate East tubes station 15 minute walk to Liverpool Street Station or Shoreditch box park It is situated right at the bottom of brick lane next to Whitechapel art gallery There s everything you need within walking distance We never got breakfast at the hotel There are numerous places to have breakfast close by Within 5 10 minute walk is The Cereal Killer Cafe The Breakfast Club Spitalfields Market and also highly famous Beigel Bakery on brick lane Can t beat a bagel and cream cheese for 1 ,0,102,1
 The room was small but cozy The bed sheets and towels were very clean but the overall aspect of the room was not The carpet could use better vacuuming furniture was a bit chipped and showed signs of extensivr use the carpet could use Bathtub paint was chipped water temperature was uneven got burned a few times unexpectedly The bathroom door was broken Breakfast buffet had good diversity definitely worth the money Location was so so A little sketchy sex shops nearby and a bunch of homeless people but was near good restaurants and shopping Far from main turist sites ,0,102,1
 Close to everything 5 min walk from Buckingham station half block from Victoria so it was easy to take the Heathrow express to Paddington then change to Victoria tube train The hotel was totally booked so our 2 rooms were on different floors One was great and one was awful Both were booked as a double room The awful one was a handicap room with no view and unappealing Decor The good one was a normal room Showers were amazing Breakfast was really good variety meats and cheeses as well as pastries Cappuccino and soda cost extra Would stay again ,0,102,1
 Everything about the Nadler reminds its guests of a more gracious bygone age closer to Downton Abbey than a noisy crowded modern hotel Our room was small but very comfortable Its design made excellent use of the available space and its amenities were terrific a lovely shower and a fully stocked little dinette for example Besides being an elegant old world establishment the Nadler boasts a wonderful staff of young energetic concierges who cannot do enough for their guests My husband and I really enjoyed our stay in London and the Nadler was a large part of that memorable experience ,0,102,1
 Friendly helpful staff you need anything at all just let us know I asked directions for a location and without asking them they printed off a map of the location Room small but beautifully appointed clean and spotless I ve stayed in 5star hotels not up to the same standard Porter gave us extra tea and coffee without hesitation Great location for our needs Will definitely stay again in spite of them double charging me for the original booking quickly rectified I may add All in all a great experience and we are staying again next Thursday we cant wait ,0,102,1

 We arrived after a flight to Brussels then a train to Paris and finally a taxi to the hotel They were able to store our bags while we walked around Paris The staff was most friendly and ready with a recommendation for dinner at a nearby delicious restaurant The room had a great set up for a family as their was a low partition between the beds We could see our daughter but she wasn t directly next to us The beds were comfortable and the room was clean I wish we were able to stay longer than one night ,0,102,1
 We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Monsieur The location was so central and close to attractions yet removed enough to make you still feel like you re in a local area The rooms were incredibly spacious not at all what we were expecting given past stays in tiny European hotel rooms and the decor alternates from one room to another guaranteeing a truly boutique and artsy experience We loved the breakfast and the bespoke teas left in our room every evening Definitely a fabulous spot to enjoy a Parisian vacation felt super upscale an chic without breaking the bank ,0,102,1
 This hotel is really a great choice for Barcelona Just outside the city center noise and dust Its 15 mins away by metro from Placa Catalunya city center The Metro station is just by the hotel There is a big mall close by that has all the boutiques and restaurants you want It is close to the beach as well The rooms are spacious the bed extra comfy and the breakfast is really perfect The swimming pool area is a good break from walking the town The rooms are sound proof and the view is spectacular We really enjoyed everything ,0,102,1
 We loved everything about this hotel The stylish interiors the location the immaculate cleanliness of the rooms but most of all the wonderful staff Friendly knowledgeable and welcoming nothing was too much trouble They were not obsequious just very natural and friendly My husband celebrated a birthday during our stay and on return to our room on that afternoon there was a place of delicious cakes for us to share with a personal note Free daily newspaper wine fruit juice and waters just fabulous Would definitely recommend as a super hotel to stay at when staying in this amazing city ,0,102,1
 This is a location you might think of for your sejour in Vienna There is a tram 5 mins of walking that will take you right in the heart of the city at the Wien Opera The rooms are very clean spacious and they got modern furniture The breakfast was really tasty of course could be more various but after all it will do its job the blue cheese was awesome So if you want not to spend to much money on expensive hotels in the centre of town you will definitely want to consider this as a perfect location ,0,102,1
 I could check in a couple of hours earlier after an exhausting flight So what did I get a large sunny room and a jacuzzi in the middle of it You take a bath you have a nap you enjoy the city from the terrace on the roof and then go for a walk across Vienna which is magnificent Special thanks to Luca guy at the reception The next day I had breakfast which was quite alright although coffee is not just fine as in Italy you get fresh milk fruit cocktail that I ve never met before Highly recommended ,0,102,1
 Superbly luxurious hotel with amazing catering The bed was super comfy the bedroom lovely and spacious with a view across to Vienna s lovely Votivkirche Breakfast was exceptional with literally everything on offer and tea and cakes every day too Some people have said it s a long way out Well it s walking distance to the centre around 15 mins but also on the excellent Tram D route which takes travellers into the city and out to the Vienna Woods There s a regular bus too 40A Lovely bars and restaurants nearby and very quiet We would definitely return ,0,102,1
 The bed was extremely comfy and the decor of the room was very classy Lovely vintage touches like the phone and radio and huge windows with beautiful views Also the room was much bigger than I thought The photos do not do the hotel justice The staff were more than happy to help with anything giving us maps and drawing easiest routes to get to places and suggesting good places to visit Also even though breakfast not included you get a breakfast bag in morning with banana granola and orange juice which was a lovely touch Will DEFINITELY be returning ,0,102,1
 The Falkensteiner Hotel Wien Margareten is a relatively new hotel with clean and modern facilities The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean and excellent We stayed for five nights and found the hotel to be conveniently located two blocks from a metro station that was three stations away from the city centre The breakfast buffet was extensive and the quality of the food was excellent Our room overlooked the street which was quiet and had a nice outlook but we had to draw the curtains at night as flashes from the tram were like lightening not a problem ,0,102,1
 Booked this Hotel for my Parents 30th Anniversary present The staff could not do enough for them They went above and beyond to make their stay pleasant My parents were so happy with the Hotel Room and actually stated that it was the nicest hotel they ever stayed in They said they will return again and they are quite hard to please sometimes They could not say enough about it They also stated that the breakfast was amazing and they loved the bar too So if you are thinking of going to Amsterdam Do not pass this hotel Ruth Ireland ,0,102,1
 The bed was super comfy and the staff very friendly It was our honey moon so the staff gave us a bottle of cava which was really nice The location is pretty far from the main part of the city though which was unfortunate but overall it was a nice stay The rooftop pool area is great but the price to rent a sunbed is extortionate Also the coffee served is from a nespresso machine I would have thought that would be included given the pods are on y 30 pence each and we were charged 3 euros a coffee ,0,102,1
 The rooms were luxurious and there was a free mini bar which was restocked as needed The staff were all super friendly The receptionists escorted you everywhere instead of pointing us in the direction needed We were offered umbrellas as soon as we arrived Reception was very professional The breakfast was enormous Unlimited good coffee too Nice heritage building Housekeeping staff were friendly and professional English was all good The wellness centre is a great place to relax when waiting for your flights They had a pool warmer than 32C A spa and several saunas at 70 and 90 F ,0,102,1

 Our two night stay at The Tower was a perfect The room we had was a very good size and very clean and with all the amenities and the location couldn t have been better We had upgraded to the executive room which we were a little unsure of at the time but would definitely recommend and do again The breakfast was delicious and the before dinner canopies were the perfect thing to come back to before getting changed and heading back out The staff were all very helpful and welcoming and we look forward to staying here again soon ,0,102,1
 We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and we can say the hotel is not very far from the city Center In the room there is a flat TV minibar and also a safe The room is clean but the furniture is old and there is a smell in the room I think from the bathroom In the bathroom there is a bidet and hairdryer All in all if you visit Milan for sightseeing and you don t spend the whole trip in the room this hotel could be taken into account since it has a good price ratio ,0,102,1
 Super friendly staff The hotel was great There were people there of all ages and backgrounds playing ping pong or just hanging out with friends or on their computers in the main area The lighting and ambience were terrific Bike rental was super easy and affordable The room was super comfortable and I enjoyed the way the key activated the lights and turned them off when no one was in the room as to save energy I enjoyed the quotes that were randomly placed throughout the hotel Someone put a lot of thought and care in creating this amazing hotel ,0,102,1
 Ideal location for Paddington station and the parks And only a good walk to the west end weather permitting Greeting from the reception was friendly and welcoming Rooms were small but well appointed Lack of bath in rooms was a little disappointing but shower was good No public space to relax Apart from a sofa in reception and a very small bar We didn t eat breakfast But the food we saw looked very good The staff in all departments were polite knowledgeable and helpful as well as looking smart and sharp We as a family enjoyed our time here,0,101,1
 In order to attend a daylong course in London I needed to stay in town for a couple of nights By basing ourselves at the Kensington not only could I walk to UCL which is just round the corner but the proximity to the tube meant we were only a couple of stops from the Westend for the couple of shows we crammed in and the Heathrow Express to return home after a super time The Kensington is relaxed characterful and elegant and the staff are both friendly and proficient We would happily return just need a good excuse ,0,101,1
 Management and staff were extremely kind and polite Any time spent in Paris makes you brush up on your manners Our room was spacious and quiet even though overlooking the main street across from Cafe Flores Great as a base to explore the great St Germain neighbourhood A charming French hotel The cafes nearby are great for breakfast and historic Brasserie Lipp is right next door having dinner there was an experience the room just gets buzzier as the night progresses Waiters who are so professional they love their work and the restaurant St Germain is a wonderful area ,0,101,1

 The staff were excellent and welcoming Beautiful room We had a disability room and it was excellent Two different shower bench facilities Quiet room good size The location is right at the heart of Dam Square but once inside peaceful Small entry meant we had very few steps from front door to elevator and disabled room was close to elevator so great access Lemon water and apples available all day and water bottles on request We also were provided welcome wine and munchies The new restaurant is modern not as elegant but a nice varied menu and excellent pizza ,0,101,1
 From the minute we were greeted at reception until the minute we left the hotel the staff was kind and helpful The location is excellent easy stroll to museums restaurants trams A very quiet street in the center of the Museum area The front desk staff had tickets for museums so that one didn t need to stay in lines during busy times There was flavored water available when returning to the hotel and a nice honor bar with coffee wine beer and drinks The elevator is a treat All is all a wonderful stay and we would return ,0,101,1
 I was impressed with the room designed to look like a luxurious sleeping accomodation on the Orient Express The staff were exceedingly helpful and that included help in connecting with the Net My full English breakfast was done to perfection and I was thrilled to have it served to me at my table None of this floundering about when having to find one s way around self service Even the milk for my coffee was hot The location is just perfect only across the street from St Pancras International if one has to get the Eurostar Definitely worth a return,0,101,1
 Unhappy with the room we were allocated on arrival and had a word with Sean on reception the next morning He undertook to try and resolve the problem in a professional manner When we returned to the hotel later in the day we were delighted with his efforts Had a lovely room wine and cake in Greenwich for my husband birthday luggage moved and no effort had been spared We stay at the hotel on a regular basis and will continue to do so Congratulations and thanks to Sean always great when a person exceeds expectations Maggie and John Blackler,0,101,1
 Had to book at last minute after receiving notice the reservation I had for months was cancelled due to mixup and we were arriving in Barcelona in 2 days I had stayed here 3 prior times so was familiar with hotel location Our room had a handicap shower there was no shelf to put shampoo soap etc on A handicapped person would ve also found this helpful The garden view was a very ugly backside of other buildings Other than that the room was nice very clean and comfortable The breakfast and staff were top notch along with the location,0,101,1
 Diego and all the staff at the hotel The Serras are an absolute delight The level of service they delivered constantly was exceptional across the board Food and wine at the hotel was outstanding cocktails at the rooftop bar oh how we miss them I can whole heartedly recommend the hotel The Serras to any one visiting the beautiful city of Barcelona P S Check out De Antonio yachts ask in the hotel we chartered a boat with them to watch the sunset over the city sky line which was an awesome experience the perfect end to our trip ,0,101,1
 The whole experience was outstanding the staff were friendly smart and could not help us enough The rooms were classy with all modern facilities for example above the desk there were multiple socket types that would accept every type of electrical plug from around the world no adaptors needed in addition there were sockets to connect all types of media directly into the TV Another example of The Langham anticipating your needs prior to you knowing you have them The Artesian cocktail bar inside the hotel was also an unexpected delight I can not recommend The Langham enough 10 10,0,101,1
 I am globally satisfied by the stay at Hotel Regina it represents a good compromise between quality and price The standard double room was not very big and the one in which we stayed had just a view on an internal cavedio but it was clean and quiet Breakfast is more than appropriate The Hotel is in a very good location to reach the city center well connected to metro and tram at walking distance A car parking is at a walking distance as well The wifi sometimes does not work properly but it is ok for a short stay,0,101,1
 A block from the metro station Staff very friendly The women serving breakfast were always cheerful and would chat with the visitors in Spanish German English we heard it all One woman who worked the front desk did some research after we asked her a question and came back with a paper showing her findings when we returned in the afternoon Really impressive that she remembered us and our question Very helpful to have breakfast served until 11am for those on a leisure trip and the afternoon pick me up of coffee and cake 3 6pm was a bonus ,0,101,1
 The staff were very friendly and accommodating Took the time to ask what we planned to do see at check in and gave detailed information on this including writing instructions and pointing out things like where to get on off public transport on a map Great location close enough to city centre on public transport but also far enough out to get peace Also great shuttle service to and from the Airport aswell as a very secure luggage room to leave bags on the final day after wend checked out instead of dragging them round with us all day ,0,101,1
 Gorgeous hotel rooms were comfy and luxurious The turn down service at night was wonderful as they left chocolates with the note Buona notte next to your bed every evening The rooftop terrace bar was excellent The perfect addition to our stay We sat with a glass of Pinot Grigio watching the sunset after a day of sightseeing around beautiful Milan There were free nibbles provided and when the wind picked up I was given a cosy blanket to help avoid being chilly It s the little things that count and this hotel has certainly paid attention to those ,0,101,1
 We stayed for 2 nights Room was the same as in the photos Spacious clean gorgeous Breakfast was very rich Wifi was perfect The location of the hotel is outside of the centre of Milan However there is a metro station 10 15 minutes walk from the hotel which takes you straight down to Milan Duomo For anyone arriving by car and want a parking space before you turn right to arrive at the entrance of the hotel continue straight until the end of the road and turn left and continue straight That s where the hotel parking is ,0,101,1
 The location is fantastic Most of London s biggest attractions are within walking distance The room I was in had a decent view I was given an upgrade free of charge The room had complimentary bottled water and tea it had an ironing board and a hair dryer All nice touches which did go a long way to leaving a good impression Friendly staff Valentina at the front desk was very helpful It s not a budget hotel at least by my standards I know London is a very expensive city but you definitely get what you pay for ,0,101,1
 The rooms were big and beautiful nothing to complain about the only problem we had was we had booked adjoining rooms and when we went to the hotel they said they don t have adjoining rooms it was the fault of bookings com to mention that it was adjoining rooms and not the hotels fault so with the kids we had to use 2 rooms which was inconvenient really to be in completely separate rooms and the location is not that great and a little scary to travel after dark the staff not that friendly or helpful either ,0,100,1
 Hotel was clean and staff very friendly and helpful It was located only 5min walk from Hammersmith underground station so very handy for travelling into central London We flew into Stansted which was about 50mins train journey to Liverpool Street then a further 30mins to Hammersmith on underground The hotel was also close to a shopping centre and places to eat however the restaurants in the hotel looked very nice Our room looked like it had recently been decorated and the rest of hotel was under going renovation during our stay Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting London ,0,100,1
 Location and view are key at this charming hotel For a short visit for tourism or for business in the central city one would hardly need transportation If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful The courtesy of the staff can t be surpassed Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored ,0,100,1
 We booked a junior suite and it was beautiful The bathroom was all marble and spacious with a big bath and a separate shower There was even a kitchen with a big fridge freezer and a washing machine The suite was lovely decorated and it felt really luxurious Wonderful coming back to it after a full day spent walking around London The restaurant was absolutely gorgeous and the breakfast a superb affair The staff is very friendly prompt in helping extremely polite and well trained All in all it was a fantastic experience I can highly recommend it ,0,100,1
 I was staying in a hotel that was an absolute nightmare I walked into the Hilton doubletree hotel with tears in my eyes because of what I had went through leaving the previous hotel on such a short notice The gentleman and the lady right away gave me a bottle of water and helped me sort myself out and gave me a beautiful room to stay in at an amazing rate I was beyond happy with all they did I couldn t thank them enough I certainly will stay with them again when I visit London another time ,0,100,1
 We got a free upgrade for an amazing suite The Blue Lamp so my review is for this room The suite was stunnig we got free water coffee Nespresso tea hot chocolate and shortbread It was very clean beautiful and individual The room was very quiet we didn t hear any noise of other rooms or the streets The bed was big and comfy good blankets We loved the shower and the very big bathtub The free Wifi worked well All in all we had an awesome stay in this lovely hotel and will come back for sure ,0,100,1
 Standard of the room was very good However dinner was a disappointment as the steak was far too rare as it was ordered medium well We waited for a member of staff but there was no one around so we left without finishing the meal Also although the selection was good at breakfast I would expect for the price to have it cooked to order and not served buffet style dried out bacon To conclude I would stay at the hotel again as the location and room were exceptional however I wouldn t eat there again including breakfast ,0,100,1
 The Staff were absolutely lovely Everyone was warm friendly and really helpful They made the whole experience feel very personal even sending us a card to congratulate us on our recent marriage which was such a lovely touch The location is great Earls Court Tube Station is just at the bottom of the road and on the District Line so really easy to get to Central London too There are loads of restaurants bars and shops within walking distance of the hotel so plenty of choice We had a lovely time here and will definitely stay here again ,0,100,1
 The staff at reception was absolutly wonderful So helpful and we had a good laugh with them Great shower Clean modern room Obviously size of the rooms are Paris standard but even then my partner who s 2m tall had no hassle Location we were close to everything Several metro stations in the vicinity making getting around so easy Corner of the street there s a Monop so any last minute forgotten items can be found there It s open until midnight There s a bank nearby as well For the coffee addicts 2 starbucks at 7min walk ,0,100,1
 surprisingly my room was already ready for check in at 12 30 pm the very friendly doorman who calls a taxi for you and opens the door it s the little things The fast and friendly room service yummy drinks at the hotel bar Super friendly staff a very lovely british room very clean and very close to Westminster Cathedral Jamie Oliver Gordon Ramsay Westminster Abbey London Eye Buckingham Palace and walking distance to Victoria Station I would recommend this to everyone who s looking for a typical british experience I will definitely go back i loved it ,0,100,1
 The guy at the reception named Alejandro was super helpful with everything we were a big family group of 8 people and he was always up for anything we asked I also forgot my watch at the hotel and he kindly send it to me via post to my home Staff in general were kind and friendly Hotel is nice and close to the station so it s easy to get anywhere by metro or tram Breakfast it s nice also not so many restaurants around the hotel to go for dinner at night Overall a good experience ,0,100,1
 We had a room with a stunning view of the tower of London The staff were all extremely helpful We were treated to two complimentary drinks at the hotel bar and was even brought a slice of cake to the room as it was my birthday The beds were huge and super comfortable The roof top bar had a great view of the shard and canary wharf The hotel is central and was very easy to get to restaurants in west London All in all great stay in a very accommodating hotel I would definitely stay here again ,0,100,1
 The bed was very comfortable decor in the hotel is modern retro and not dated at all The staff were so helpful and very lovely to chat to For both of our evenings they recommended us two great restaurants The hotel was clean and fresh smelling shower was nice and hot we even were given robes and slippers Great location it was just couple of metro stops from Gar du Nord and a couple stops in the other direction to the Louvre close enough to travel but far away enough from the touristic traffic Thanks for a great stay,0,100,1
 Just a few blocks from Kensington Garden and Hyde Park this nice Bayswater hotel offers splendid combo of style and location That s wether you like a walk or a run before breakfast in Notting Hill area which also offer great restaurants and burger joints Be sure to book the right room according to your preferences as the rooms are rather small in this area The service of the manager Zara and her team including Milagris is unsurpassed They will do anything to accomodate your needs to make you feel at home We would love to come back ,0,100,1
 positive The staff were very friendly Negative breakfast buffet for 20 and for a 4 star hotel was very very poor even the breakfast room was not a pleasant area My room had a window to the yard where the restaurant guest were sitting so although I was on 5th floor i could hear people talking and laughing there Inside the room the Refrigerator was the biggest noise generator I even tried to unplug it but no chance Being in Paris on business for only one day and not being able to sleep properly is not really eficient ,0,100,1
 I just returned from a 6 night stay at Citadines Suites Arc Dr Triomphe Paris and their attention to detail and the treatment I received from the concierge to the housekeeping staff was phenomenal They really cared about making my hotel stay as comfortable as possible Housekeeping made sure my room never lacked of nespresso coffee and clean towels I definitely appreciated the complimentary large bottle of water waiting there after a long flight and the l occitane toiletries Their gym facility is also very impressive The hotel can easily rival any 5 star hotel in my opinion ,0,100,1
 The location is very good the metro is very close just a few meters away We were on the first floor on our first night which was not a very good room It was a bit noisy from the sounds on the streets and there was some noise in the room probably from the AC or something We moved to the 6th floor the next day which is much better more quiet without the noise The staff was nice The breakfast was very good plenty of choices I would stay here again should I go back to Paris ,0,100,1
 The location is great and very convenient right next to the Gloucester Rd tube station and walking distance from the museums The staff was very helpful and accommodating The room was spacious and very clean We had an issue with getting a room with two single beds instead of one double bed as we requested via Booking but it was taken care of rather quickly with the staff even moving our luggage themselves from the old room to the new Overall it is quiet despite being located on a busy road Highly recommended and will definitely visit again ,0,100,1
 The location was amazing right across from the cathedral on the edge of the Gothic Quarter Not to be missed is the spectacular view from the 7th floor observation deck with beverage service from the hotel bar The recently renovated room was spacious and comfortable with a great shower The staff was very friendly and helpful anxious to please and very professional If you arrive by car there is an extremely convenient underground public parking garage 50 meters from the hotel s door and the Rambla is only a short walk away Altogether a memorable place to stay ,0,100,1
 From the initial greeting given to us when checking in Natalie to the warm goodbyes exchanged a week later this hotel was A Randa was extremely helpful with directions suggestions all given with a big smile and lots of sincerity Joshua was extremely efficient when we had a slight problem with the AC No contestation quick solution all done amiably Even a good recommendation for supper the next evening As for the comfort linens bed shower all top notch Will return for sure Oh I forgot the breakfast was not inexpensive but well worth the cost Very good ,0,100,1
 The lady working at the check in was really kind she even gave us the tip where to park our car and which tickets to get The guy that was with her was rather quiet and seemed uninteressted The bed was really comfortable The electricity is activate with the room key card which is good in one way cause you cant forget to turn off things but its bad cause you cant leave anything to charge while youre out But all in all it was an amazing stay and its really clean and cozy would do it again ,0,100,1
 The young man on staff who greeted us and gave us an overview of Barcelona and the hotel s amenities was delightful And the staff also greeted us by name when we arrived helped us arrange a taxi when we departed and communicated with the driver in Spanish on our behalf Thank you staff The hotel also had cute his her slippers by our bed a separate w c which I appreciate fun and extensive complimentary treats and breakfast made to order a gorgeous 6th floor terrace overlooking the city Which we d had way more time here ,0,100,1
 The location for us was excellent Staff were pleasant although not the chattiest Plenty to see and do no matter where you go Hotel is situated next to the dock which was nice to be able to go for a stroll morning or night Shops and restaurants near by Easy to commute to and from using the DLR train But remember to get an Oyster Card Wheelchair friendly too Rooms at the Hotel were cleaned every day Beds very comfortable and clean Good showering facilities Just an excellent place to stay in all You will never be bored ,0,100,1
 The front desk staff headed up by Zen were amazing as always extremely polite welcoming and accommodating We were allowed a late checkout no problem at all and our return flight boarding passes they printed out for us Anything ordered to the room was there almost immediately Great breakfast too The hotel is central to the city and conveniently located for shopping and sightseeing I have stayed here many times over the last 7 years and have tried other hotels in Barcelona but this hotel has become my firm favourite and coming back here feels like coming home ,0,100,1
 The location of the hotel to the old district and shopping areas is superb The staff are super friendly and go out of their way to help you out The breakfast was vast and tasty suiting everybody s needs including a gluten free section with its own separate cheese and ham section We also had new year s eve dinner at the hotel and it was fantastic Check in and check out were very swift and an added bonus is that every afternoon from 5 8pm they serve free tea service with sandwiches and tarts Will definitely revisit ,0,100,1
 There was an issue on arrival as we had booked 2 adults and 1 child but at the hotel they only had information about the adults I had taken the paperwork confirming the numbers so there was no dispute They did not have a pull out bed so we ended up sharing This was fine in the end BUT the duty manager and all her staff were lovely and couldn t have been more helpful we even were given complementary breakfast The booking system between booking com and the hotel needs reviewing to avoid this in the future ,0,100,1
 The room was specious and well furnished with many electric plugs including usb The bed was amazing Very comfortable Breakfast was also very good with variety of fresh products Location was great aside the tram and the railway station I like the fact that through the app you could book and select your room and use your telephone as door key Although online check in needs an update Another thing that hotel provides for free is water So simple and precious but so expensive in some countries of Europe I defenetly stay again it became my favorite hotel ,0,100,1
 This quirky hotel is friendly and welcoming We have stayed here several times The lobby dining area is nice with good quality breakfast meals and drinks The location is great for driving into Vienna and it s a also a short walk to HBF train station It s a bit of a long walk into the city center but the tram stop is very close and easy The rooms are comfortable but I wish they offered more and firmer pillows You just get one thin one per person A mini bar in the room would also be nice ,0,100,1

 Truly luxury experience and the splendid interior design of the room as well as the supreme view to the Ringstra e Boulevard from the last third floor are among the many reasons why I truly fell in love with the gorgeous Grand Deluxe Room 369 In addition the electronically adjustable control buttons for switch on off and temperature of the bath tube and the shower are very useful tools to increase the cosy and relaxing atmosphere in the room especially if there is s special occasion for your stay as in my case St Valentine s Day ,0,99,1

 Great location just outside the city centre with a tram stop within 200 yards of the hotel Staff very friendly and helpful Shuttle bus to from the airport was great and only cost 7 euros per person WHEN YOU ARRIVE AND LEAVE THE AIPORT do not trust the men standing near the exit asking if you need a taxi they are not actual taxi drivers and will charge you a fortune we would have paid 60 euros if we hadn t used the shuttle bus and it s a 15 minute journey Would definitely stay here again ,0,99,1
 It was a really nice stay at NH Amsterdam Zuid the staff are extremely helpful and friendly with special thanks to Roxanne who was very informative I just wished that the hotel had allowed early check in without a charge like most hotel especially since the room was already available Very convenient 10 mins walk to tram and metro which went into Central and within walking distance to a new Geraldplien shopping mall with lots of restaurants unfortunately we only discovered on our last day Also within walking distance to Amstel Park which was great for kids ,0,99,1

 Good location easy to find from Baker St underground station Staff were friendly helpful The room was clean and very comfortable It was a basement room so it was a little bit dark but we were only staying for one night so it wasn t a problem If we had been staying longer I would have preferred to have a room on a higher floor with windows that can open Facilities in the room were great Lovely clean bathroom with a good shower Breakfast was very nice there was a good range of traditional continental options ,0,98,1

 My stay was during the Terrorist attacks November 13 15 The hotel sent out a letter to all guests to outline the extra security measures that were put into place immediately security guards at the entrance and waiver of early check out fees if guests opted to leave The entire staff was very accommodating during that horrible event and helped me get in touch with the embassy which was very close to the hotel The hotel is in a great location and walking distance to most points of interest couple blocks Place dela Concorde Louvre etc ,0,98,1

 Staff staff staff They were all excellent very professional and very friendly as well The hotel is close to Jardin du Luxembourg and very close to 2 Metro lines It s a little bit farther from the river than a tourist might like but this has the advantage of the area being less full of tourists and more French The cafe around the corner L Horizon is also excellent with friendly staff and quality food not really cheap though You don t have to walk far to have your coffee and croissant in the morning sun ,0,98,1

 This hotel was so good that it changed my husband s attitude about travel in Europe I love to travel He usually prefers the comfort of home He gives it 5 stars and that is saying a lot I ve described the decor as upscale design with a sense of humor It was quiet comfortable and clean but these descriptors don t do it justice The front desk people were helpful efficient and friendly all of them and all of the time If we travel to Vienna in the future we WILL stay with them again ,0,98,1

 Elegant clean and modern furniture I always look after the details and i was amazed when i saw GROHE collection in the bathroom Such detailed thing gives you a message on their level of care I would also like to mention the staff hospitality the smile is drawn in their faces all the time Special thanks to the receptionist Victor who was supportive all the time The location is superb where the hotel is surrounded by lots of cafe s decent restaurants bakeries groceries and pharmacies All of the above is provided with affordable price ,0,97,1

 Extremely nice staff very smart design of the room and the hotel Spacious shower big fluffy towels and comfy slippers excellent pillows with an additional choice of pillows a la carte finally perfect night sleep conditions Fantastic location Our room window was facing a kind of church so no neighbors to peek into the room Don t count much on the pool though It s very tiny but still the roof top terrace was a nice place to look at the city read a book and enjoy the sun Overall we had a wonderful stay ,0,97,1
 The best part about the property is the location The hotel is literally connected to the local train service which is only 40 minutes from central London You can walk from the hotel lift to the train in roughly 2 minutes The amenities in the hotel itself were brilliant and exactly as they look in the pictures The gym is 24 hours along with a snack area and reception The pool doesn t shut to 11pm and the bar stays open till 12 What more could you want from a fantastic location and amazing property ,0,97,1
 Convenient location very close metro 4 line Bogatel station or metro 1 line Glories or Marina station Seaside also close Still on the way to hotel the views are not so good but the location is really safe lots of bars and restaurants nearby Everywhere you can go easily I like it all here though for me there was a little lack of cleanness I found few hairs in my bed But still all was ok Breakfast nice The hotel is so beautiful I liked the hotel bar so much So tasty Sangria and Cava ,0,97,1
 Loved it everything Biggest thanks we would love to say to all staff members who helped out at night to call out dr for our 5 year old Guy receptionist rang number of different hospitals and Dr s to find one to call out Next day receptionists where very understanding and let us stay with our sick child in the room till our late flight Thanks to kitchen staff who cared if child will be fed when gets better Everything was brilliant Super clean room Quiet hotel Location perfect Pillows super comfy Everything Just superb ,0,97,1
 We were warmly welcomed to the hotel and every encounter we had with the staff was top drawer All suggestions given at the front desk were right on A special shout out to Noah on the friont desk who was helpful knowledgeable and personable and made our stay superb The hotel s location is wonderfully close to the Casa Mills and the Casa Batll The outside patio was a wonderful surprise It was a bit pricy but we thought it was worth every penny If we ever go to Barcelona again we would stay here ,0,97,1
 A once again excellent stay at the Rookery It s a beautiful property in the heart of Clerkenwell a particularly interesting and untouristy part of Central London just adjacent to The City Staff are super friendly professional and conscientious In spite of the nearby club life I find it to be a quiet and restful aerie from the hubbub of London Breakfast is not included though there is food available to order to your room or the charming lounge but this is not an issue for me especially with so many excellent food choices nearby ,0,97,1
 We had so much fun here The staff are so kind and helpful The kitchen facilities are really nice and well stocked The beds and pillows are very comfortable The WIFI was really fast The rooftop pool was the best part It is shallow and my kid loved it and we spent a lot of time up there The view from the hotel is beautiful And the hotel is in a great location we could walk to the beach restaurants and the tour bus stops and there is a supermarket a few steps from downstairs ,0,97,1
 We missed our flight and arrived one day later The hotel kindly upgraded us to a superior room with a great view of the main square and also included breakfast for free and said we could check out later than usual on our last day which I thought was a nice touch We didn t ask for any of the above and I thought it was such a good move by the hotel to make up for our lost day Staff are professional and friendly and we would definately stay here again when in Barcelona ,0,97,1
 The hotel is in an excellent location It s modern very clean and contemporary The staff are extremely friendly The breakfasts were excellent with a great selection The rooftop bar was lovely and again with great staff The room was finished off very well and the shower was fantastic The free mini bar was a nice touch The airport transfer bus drops off and picks up about a 2 3 minute walk away I would highly recommend this hotel When we return to Barcelona this will be the first hotel we ll check for availability ,0,97,1
 Brilliant staff so friendly We put our do not disturb on the door every day an took it off when we went out and the maid still cleaned the room The room was spotless had some english channels too which was a bonus Great view aswell 10minute walk from a connection train to amsterdam central station My advice use the train to get to the hotel from airport as the taxi there was 51 No shops around the hotel so if you need anything grab it in the town REALLY NICE ALL ROUND THANK YOU ,0,97,1
 This is a beautiful old hotel really well situated to get to everything very easily The staff are generally very friendly and helpful however one of the front desk staff gave me the wrong information she had even checked with a colleague as she seemed unsure still got it wrong so I ended up missing a tour as I was waiting in the wrong place and when I finally got to the meeting point the tour had left and of course no refund This was disappointing but the only blot on an otherwise outstanding property ,0,97,1
 We love this charming hotel and have stayed here three times now The decor is sumptuous and cozy The rooms are certainly not minimalist There are flower patterns cushions and quirky chandeliers The bathroom is great and equipped with l occitane products There is always something sweet to welcome you back to the hotel during the day Usually a lovely apple pie and hot coffee or tea The bar is a place to wear your best dress and shoes before changing into flats to walk along the cobbles to one of the many nearby restaurants ,0,97,1
 Staff were very welcoming and helpful Room was cosy had all the facilities you d require and was very clean The bar and restaurant were open late serving good drinks and food All the artwork around the building was quirky and gives the hotel something over others It is a little further out of the town than some hotels but there is a bus stop just outside with a regular service and a day pass for busses and trams is only a few euro Takes 10 minutes at most to get in to the town ,0,97,1
 We were welcomed before we stepped into the doors the doorman added an extra touch We were warmly greeted at the Reception Desk and were made to feel like we were the only guests staying there The room was perfect not too hot not too cold the bed was heavenly the bathroom was spotless and had everything we needed and more The free Wi Fi was an added bonus In a nutshell we are going to be staying there anytime we go to London and recommend the May Fair to anyone looking to pamper themselves ,0,97,1
 The hotel is pretty central good transport links approx 50 mins away from the airport using the Metro The staff is young and very friendly The design of the lobby was really nice and also the room was good size with great views on the 5th floor The breakfast is also good with all the basics and also hot meals choice like omelettes and pancakes from the meny at no extra cost The rooftop bar restaurant and terrace are amazing for drinks and meals Great for chilled eveinings with your friends before a night out ,0,97,1
 We stayed for 2 night at this hotel and was really good value for money The Hotel is in the North part of Milan city centre but you can go easily with Metro to the centre in about 25 min The room was clean really quite with a confortable bed and nice light The breakfast was good with fresh food with a good italian coffee and a good service We paid 8 Euro a night for a private parking that is a really good value in Milan We will back again in this good Hotel ,0,97,1
 The Hotel Kaiserin Elizabeth is a two minute walk from St Stephen s Cathedral and a minute from kaffe Frauenhuber where both Mozart and Beethoven played The concierge at the hotel was excellent knowledgeable about the local area polite and personable even though when I first arrived I was a little dishevelled from my journey up from Morahalom in Hungary The room was lovely the bed very comfortable and breakfast delicious I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and Vienna in general to any traveller it was an utter pleasure to have stayed here ,0,97,1
 WE loved the room and the ability to have breakfast and afternoon tea and evening drinks at the hotel with the upgrade Despite the construction around the hotel it was very pleasant We had a view of the London Eye from our room and at night it was spectacular The hotel is convenient to Westminster Bridge Big Ben Parliament the War Museums etc We left just before the latest terror attacks on London Bridge and area so enjoyed it all thoroughly We could hop on and off the Big Tour buses right near the hotel ,0,97,1
 The hotel had only just opened so everything was brand new all the facilities are great and there are table tennis tables and other games in the communal areas Staff were amazing we travelled to Amsterdam on a whim so wanted some advice as to where to go and what to see and all staff gave us excellent recommendations Cohen greeted us with smiles and an ice cream on arrival Located right next to a metro stop it is walkable to the centre in 30 minutes or around 10 minutes by metro Would highly recommend ,0,97,1
 Our stay here was excellent from the location to the staff We got the room with a view and it was absolutely amazing you could see the arc so close the pictures don t do it justice This was our first time in Paris and we loved it Farouk went out of the way to help us and book stuff we wanted to do around the city if it wasn t for him the stay wouldn t have been the same he was as good as the view we had Would definitely recommend it ,0,96,1
 From the moment we stepped in the door the staff was very attentive We were upgrades to a delux room on 12th floor with lovely views We were in London to celebrate my birthday and when we entered the room there were a beautiful platter with fruit an macaroons and a handwritten note to whish me a happy birthday Now that is what I call service In addition the decor in the hotel is lovely and it is close to Kings Cross with its many lovely restaurant and bars Will definitely stay here again ,0,96,1
 The staff were very friendly and helpful The main lift was out of order however there was a service lift which was perfectly usable The management informed me about the lift as soon as I checked in and provided complimentary beers for the inconvenience The tube station is just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel There s both a small Tesco store as well as another store that sells SIM cards drinks chips etc Many good restaurants and cafes around the hotel Enjoyed my stay there and would definitely stay there again ,0,96,1
 I stayed in the executive suite and the view was breath taking Staff was so friendly and helpful Facilities were great ice bucket and glasses with mini bar a little space to put your personal items in ice machine on same floor as the room I found the bar and restaurant on the expensive side and decided not to eat there but had a drink Again the staff were lovely Very clean and modern bar If I visit London again I will look to stay in this hotel again as the location was fantastic ,0,96,1
 The location of this hotel is amazing just at the top of the pedestrian shopping area around the corner from the Oxford Circus underground stop Very lively shopping restaurants and crowds to be found in the evening all around the hotel but the hotel itself was super quiet and comfortable We didn t make use of the facilities other than the room because the weather was so good during our stay and we wandered all around London Did use room service one night for a later night snack and the food was quite good ,0,96,1
 Great location for Westminster St James s Park and Houses of Parliament Beautifully presented hotel with large modern comfortable room Plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby although a little quiet at weekend Also lots of snack bars if you don t have breakfast at hotel Good strong shower Paid GBP333 for two nights through booking com which I think was good value for the location and comfort of hotel Short walk to St James s Park underground which was handy for Heathrow just under 1 hour crossing platform to change at Baron s Court ,0,96,1
 CitizenM comes up top all the time This is our 3rd visit to the hotel It is in a fantastic location Easy to commute around London Southbank always wins on location Places to eat old fashioned pubs in the back streets and lots to do and see in the area within walking distance Staff are super friendly and helpful and always have a smile on their faces Thank you it makes you feel welcome and that s why we keep returning Rooms are great beds are so comfortable It is a fantastic place to stay,0,96,1
 Very beautiful room and the bathroom was incredible This was a special get away trip for us and we loved the hotel the staff in the peridot breakfast room were so polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble We loved our trip so much that we have booked to come again next year when we attend a show at the royal Albert hall It s only a few minutes walk away from the natural history museum which is my favourite thing to visit in London which was a bonus for me too ,0,96,1
 The staff were outstanding very helpful and very polite We received a very warm welcoming from the reception and exceptional service and delicious cocktails from the bar with amazing views of the city and the London eye We really appreciate the champagne and cake that was placed in our fresh very clean room for my boyfriends birthday We made a few requests and all requests were done with perfection It was a lovely stay and we would definitely return and recommend it to others as it s not too pricey and well worth it ,0,96,1
 The staff were so happy and helpful going above and beyond to ensure our stay was brilliant We spent Christmas eve in the westbridge and Christmas morning The staff made an exception for us to do a turn down service in the evening the room was fantastic breakfast was a lot better than I had expected with so much to choose from I would most definitely return again and stay in a junior suite again the value for money was amazing and the towels were so fluffy Thanks again to all at the westbridge ,0,96,1
 Attentive and very friendly staff nothing was too much trouble Fabulous location for the Shepherds Market area very easy walking distance to Buckingham Place St James Palace and New Bond Oxford streets I have been coming here for the last 26 years and have built up a good rapport with a number of the Staff and in particular Darren John and Chris Very sadly Chris is no longer with us but will be missed very much by his family colleagues and guests alike you made the place special Chris rest in peace my friend ,0,96,1
 Our room was lovely and spacious with great decor and it had everything we needed safe fridge tea coffee making facilities and plenty of hanging space Even though it faced the railway line it was very quiet Right from the start the staff were very friendly and very efficient and helpful Although the hotel is not right in the city it has easily accessible links to transport to get you where you want to go Our stay was definitely great value for a London hotel and we wouldn t hesitate to stay there again ,0,96,1
 Stylish modern and innovative For a Budget hotel this is by far the best I ve stayed in the UK Design is quirky and fun throughout Views of the Tower of London incredible Our favourite aspect was how everything in the room is controlled by Ipad Loads of free films and fun entertainment all from the comfort of an enourmous bed Very clean with really friendly staff London is full of expensive average hotels and this has dramiatically raised the bar Might not suit a more traditional traveler who can t work an IPad ,0,96,1
 I really liked the location It s the city center It s also close to the bus stop or the station The hotel is big the staff is really nice and friendly Breakfast was great I also liked that the room is spacious enough we could have tea in the room The only minus is that our room was on the 2nd floor and basically we could not see anything from the window it was half open Though I would definitely recommend the hotel and will come back here if I m in London ,0,96,1
 Over the years I have stayed at many hotels in London For me this hotel represents the best style of accommodation on all levels that I have found The atmosphere is friendly and the level of staff hospitality is exceptional The rooms are well appointed and tastefully furnished and are all done with the comfort of guests in mind The hotel is situated in a very desirable part of inner London where accommodation of a similar standard in nearby hotels is frequently far more expensive I cannot recommend the Premier Notting Hill highly enough ,0,96,1
 Made very welcome as soon as we were checking in until we were checking out Special surprise for my wife as the hotel found out it was her birthday and gave her at breakfast a plate with a Piramid Chocolate Moose with Happy Birthday piped on it she said it was delicious Also the hotel left her a birthday card in the room whilst we were having breakfast Couldn t fault the English breakfast either Room was very comfortable and with the hotel so close to Wembley it couldn t have been any better ,0,96,1
 It was our 6th trip to Paris and this is the best place we have stayed in The staff were exceptional and helped us in any way they could On arrival we were shown to our room which smelt of cigarette smoke and when we spoke to the receptionist she agreed and moved us to another room no questions asked There is air conditioning and a fridge which is a great thing to have If we go back to Paris we will stay here again Oh and they looked after my bicycle as well ,0,96,1
 Initially checking in we were not happy with the room as deluxe double was a small double bed right against the window which had condensation on the inside I had just had brain surgery to remove a tumour so was vulnerable and this was a Christmas present but one call to reception and it was sorted Being new years eve they had no other rooms that night but the next day we were upgraded and to a club room and on the first night we received a complimentary bottle of wine so excellent time had,0,96,1
 This was the end of our 6 weeks European holiday and a lovely way to finish From the moment we arrived Megha Singh and her team looked after us No request was too much trouble and the service was superb Great breakfasts and the Club Class was great with drinks and canap s every evening The room was serviced daily in true 5 star fashion with every item checked and replaced when used Resort style stay with true old fashioned service by far the best hotel of the 15 or so we stayed in ,0,96,1
 This hotel was one of the best I stayed at The staff were extremely helpful and even upgraded us as it was my boyfriends birthday The bar staff and restaurant staff were absolutely lovely people The pool and spa area are so relaxing and the staff there also extremely helpful The location was so central and we only used the tube once as we were able to walk everywhere Overall we loved our stay here at the park plaza and will definitely be booking to stay here again on our next trip too London ,0,96,1

 Excellent hotel in a perfect location if you are visiting the Apollo Theatre to watch a show About 10 minute walk from Victoria Coach Station and walking distance to Buckingham Palace If you don t fancy walking to Buckingham Palace a cab is less than 10 and the train station is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel Staff are very friendly and allowed us to keep our luggage after check out to save us carrying it around the city with us Will definitely be returning the next time I m in London ,0,96,1
 The staff were friendly and helpful always ready to bring us a Cappuccino or a glass of wine The breakfast was included and had a wide selection of different foods This is a boutique hotel with a unique layout that provides a comfortable homey area to sit and relax The location right on the Naviglio Grande Canal is perfect for walking and visiting the many shops and bars On the last Sunday of every month there is a giant antique market along the canal well worth staying at Maison Borella to browse the market ,0,96,1
 Surprisingly spacious room on the 1st floor Very clean and comfortable About a 10min walk to centre but the trams were on the doorstep another option into the centre Great location in a nice part of the city We did not have breakfast here as we wanted to explore local options great bakeries with decent coffee and lovely pastries for around five euros Lovely bars and restaurants and shops all minutes away we did not feel need to take the tram Few minutes walk to Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum set in a lovely park ,0,96,1
 The hotel is really nice the lobby is comfortable with a fireplace in the middle and we enjoyed ourselves sipping wine and beer at night The room is clean and nice beds are comfortable The staff is young and friendly One of the best things is location the hotel is just a 5 minute walk from the train station Amsterdam Sloterdijk and one stop 5 min to the city center by train and two or three stops 12 min to the airport That is why everything was very accessible and convenient during our stay ,0,96,1
 The buffet breakfast was gorgeous And the staff were very friendly my partner is fluent Spanish but I m not and they recognised and remembered this detail for our long weekend and also remembered how we preferred to pay for things The atmosphere in the bar was chilled and the wine went down too easily The view from the roof by the pool is very pretty and it s opposite the metro and also very near the station that goes straight to the airport Will definitely recommend and stay again if we visit Barcelona again,0,96,1
 The room was clean and modern and better than other places we have stayed at in Amsterdam that were actually more expensive so it is great value for money location is nice the area has lots of really nice pleased to eat and drink that are not over ran by tourists and is easy walking distracted to most things you want to visit Staff were very nice and helpful we also loved the little touch of free mini bar this is a lovely touch and more hotels should do this I would stay here again,0,96,1
 It was near to the public transport and away from the city center so you can relax at the hotel area and with 10 15 minutes can get to the city centre The people at the hotel are amazingly friendly and easy to talk with actually all the people we met in Amsterdam were friendly helpful and everybody speaks fluently english The breakfast was also perfect the orders were taken from the table The hotel itself has an intresting design that is worth seeing We definitely recommend Hotel V to other visitors Thank You ,0,96,1

 Staff were very friendly on arrival Was given an up grade and room was small but nice however if we weren t upgraded it may not have been as plesent It s a bit of a distance from the city It s a lovely walk into town along the river There are trains running every 15 mins If your stayi bf for a few days and want to see all of the city it s beautiful if your only staying a weekend I d book something a little closer to town Had a ball though,0,96,1

 A modern designed hotel clean and friendly However with some flaws each small but all adding because of the limited size of the rooms the architect opted not for one enclosed bathroom but three separate parts which are also combined with the closet The closet door doubles as the toilet door too Not the most convenient Also the hotel has only 3 elevators for its total 200 rooms and 13 floors causing quite a wait for an elevator to come The room windows are locked preventing open air Small desk not allowing comfortable use ,0,96,1
 This was one of the best value for money hotels I ve stayed at When I first arrived at Barcelona I left my phone in the back of a taxi and the manager did everything to help me thus leading to its safe return the rooftop pool area with views across Barcelona was lovely to relax in Very close proximity to the Main Street full of shops and the square where bus tours are available Took my mother for her birthday also and they sent up complimentary food and drink Can t rate higher ,0,96,1

 This is a fantastic hotel It doesn t look much from the outside but inside its a very clean and modern hotel The pool is small but rarely too busy so it s nice to hop in there at the end of a long days sightseeing The rooms are very comfortable and the breakfast is good Location wise it s a little out of the centre but Les Corts metro stop is only a 5 10 minute walk and from there you can get pretty much anywhere in the city with ease Highly recommended ,0,96,1
 The hotel is just couple of minutes walk from the famous Shonbrunn Palace facilities are very modern and super clean Staff is so friendly and prompt in helping their guests in difficult and so I believe all situations We d like to mention that we were really surprised with the responsiveness of their management team in making our stay enjoyable We d like to use the opportunity to thank the reception manager restaurant manager Zika and concierge Zoltan All three were equally professional and have done everything to make us feel comfortable Expectations exceeded ,0,96,1
 The breakfast spread was one of the most amazing I have ever seen The rooms were a little cosy but adequate with quality bathrooms and strong WiFi The inside of the building itself was sprawling and quite impressive The heat in Vienna at the time was stifling but the air conditioning throughout the building and rooms was fantastic The hotel is located sufficiently near to a metro is quite close to the river and is not too far from the city centre The takeaway breakfast option upon early checkout was generous and much appreciated ,0,96,1

 The location between Castello Sforzesca and Duomo is perfect if you re visiting Milan for the sights The staff was very nice and helpful The basic double room wasn t that big but had everything we needed and was very quiet The breakfast selection was rather limited but included everything we needed and was of good quality the bacon that came with the scrambled eggs was perfect and the staff was really helpful there as well Camperio House is a somewhat small place so the atmosphere in the hotel was pleasantly intimate and quiet ,0,96,1
 A true 5 star experience but with a very homely feel thanks to the welcoming and helpful staff Location of the hotel was perfect for all quarters of the City and easy to access the Metro Excellent food City Bar very relaxing and good value whilst the rooftop Skybar offered fabulous views over the illuminated if rather chilly late October after all pool Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the front desk in the bars or at the front door The quality of the hotel made a great holiday even better ,0,96,1

 The bed was really comfortable and the room was well appointed with everything one might need The staff were so helpful and pleasant directing us to an excellent restaurant with a discount and most solicitous of our needs As we were travelling the next day the location close to the Gard du Nord was convenient but even though the streets are lively all night the sound proofing was so effective I wasn t disturbed at all A thoroughly pleasant experience and this is on my short list for staying in Paris in future ,0,95,1

 The hotel is located across the square from the Barcelona Cathedral It was in between the heating and cooling seasons so we were able to leave our floor to ceiling windows cracked open most of the time to take advantage of the breeze There was a musician located on the steps of the cathedral for most of the daylight hours When we came home from walking the city it was pleasant to take a short siesta while listening to the murmur of the crowd and the strains of the musician s classical guitar ,0,95,1

 The location of this hotel is fantastic It has a lot of shoping restaurants and within walking distance of the Opera House and other attractions It is located inside a big square plaza so there is a lot of foot traffic and very few vehicles deliveries Guests may be surprised to find that the check in desk is actually on the 6th floor instead of the hotel s entrance This is understandable due to limited space at the hotel s entrance Not a problem though There are porters there to help with luggage ,0,95,1

 The hotel is in a wonderful location It s a beautiful place with lots of very very friendly and helpful staff The breakfast is tasty the beds comfortable and the bar good The only reason I didn t give it a better rating is because the TV channels kept cutting out the lights went out randomly but were very very quickly fixed and perhaps the worst the walls and floor are paper thin So when you have upstairs neighbours who come in late and staff who start early it s quite noisy ,0,94,1

 I stayed at strand palace hotel for a few days in June Certainly not worth it Although it is very well located the rooms are extremely small carpets all over the hotel and NO air conditioning in the rooms which made our stay very unpleasant considering we had some days with temperature over 30C Breakfast was very good although payed separately 12 pounds per person day Elevators very slow took the stairs most of the times even though I was staying in the 5th floor Very expensive for what it offers ,0,93,1
 I arrived very early and was allowed to use the bag store so that I didn t have to lug a suitcase around the shops The lovely lady at reception was so friendly and helpful She gave me a free map of the area which was brilliant When we booked in we were given a room on the very top of the hotel which did mean a lot of stairs but also we were away from any road noise Very clean and modern A joy We will use this lovely hotel again,0,93,1
 I stayed in a lot of hotels in Paris for 3 years now but this is one of the best Actually all I need is a good bed and a shower in a clean and quiet room for a normal price 60 80 EUR This means I stayed only a few times in Le Marais since the hotels are extremely expensive This time booking com had an offer I could not refuse and I loved it what a wonderful hotel Highly recommended I hope I will be able to stay again ,0,93,1
 The hotel was in a great location close but not too close to town The staff were very helpful and friendly and we were upgraded to a suite which was an unexpected and welcome surprise The room was opulent in its day but needs a little TLC as wear is starting to show With that said it is the first time we have stayed in a hotel where the bedroom is upstairs Very grand The breakfast was good quality and well cooked All in all a great and very enjoyable stay ,0,93,1
 Located in Paris Golden Triangle and just a block from the Champs Elysees the location was absolutely fantastic Great restaurants shops and a metro station are all within a short walking distance from the hotel The hotel is aging but full of charm and well maintained Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated Loved the balcony and the view A big thank you to the front desk staff who were wonderful accommodating and always so friendly They really made our stay very enjoyable and we look forward to staying here again ,0,93,1

 Everything Especially the location and the room was beautiful When I booked this I told them that it was for a 30th birthday treat and when we arrived we had been upgraded to a suite There was a huge 4 poster bed and happy birthday had been spelled out in rose petals on the bed Whats more we had wine and chocolates let in the room too all of which was complimentary The staff couldn t do enough to help you and were really friendly We would not hesitate in recommending ,0,93,1
 breakfast included would have been better and couple of the hooks were actually not available Baloney room and the roof top bar Was told the roof top bar was private only and that the balcony rooms are only if available The room was fine and we slept well There was however a large machine outside of the bathroom that had a loud industrial sound 24 hours a day Was good that the bathroom separated the noise from the sleeping area The location is really good and we did enjoy our stay ,0,93,1
 The hotel staff services were very welcoming as always I always stay at the Marriott Champs Elysees The staff caters always to special requests This weekend we made a special request for a take away breakfast because I was checking out to catch my train at 6 am But the hotel only starts breakfast at 6 30 am onwards The hotel staff were so kind prepared takeaway box breakfast for me and my friend to take with us It was the best Thanks to the staff for making this special request ,0,93,1

 We chose the property because of the parking We loved the location It was half a block from the metro that goes straight to the Louvre near lots of restaurants a nice wide street and best of all the front desk staff was always so nice and helpful There is also a street market right in front of the hotel two days a week Thursdays and Saturdays It s really a great place and I would stay there again We came back two more times and it was our favorite hotel ,0,93,1
 Immediately upon our arrival we were given a fantastic welcome by Veronica Patrick and Alex our room was well designed clean and spacious along with a great bed The bathroom was again well designed and we very much enjoyed our stay at this hotel I should also add that the food from the restaurant was also delicious I had steak which was cooked perfectly and my partner had Spaghetti Bolognese which was also very good Thank you to everyone at Urban Lodge Hotel for making our holiday all the more enjoyable ,0,93,1
 The location of the property is really nice especially if you tend to visit Torre Agbar neighborhood or Sagrada Familia Staff is really friendly and tend to help you in case you need it The breakfast is decent but if you are not used to diversity of tastes and types of food for the breakfast then you can have it in some other place for half of the price or even cheaper Really enjoyed that hotel read my booking remark and gave a room with a nice view as I asked ,0,93,1
 Second time we have stayed there this year Location right opposite Kings Cross tube station is perfect for getting in and out of West End which is also walkable Friendliest and most helpful staff we have ever encountered anywhere in a city hotel Spotlessly clean Room really well equipped We stayed in room 304 which was a standard double but it was huge compared to equivalent standard rooms at other hotels The room looked out at St Pancras station The windows are double glazed so there is no traffic noise whatsoever ,0,93,1
 We stayed in the Thistle Marble Arch on numerous occasions in the past BUT the standard dropped considerately and we stayed in many other hotels in the area We went back to the AMBA new name to check if there was any improvement We were pleasantly surprised the staff was wonderful the ambience was friendly and attractive and the restaurants and coffeeshops of a high standard The rooms were delightful big and airy and with a nice technological touch And naturally the AMBA is situated in the most perfect part of London,0,93,1
 Overall very pleasant experience however apart from Ricardo who was very helpful and approachable the rest of the reception staff could come across a little bit short Very mean glasses of champagne as well whenever I have ordered one they only pored half lol The Sky bar wasn t finished but the website did not mention that prior so I was quite disappointed that every time I wanted a drink I had to go down to reception where receptionists said that they are not bartenders although they stand behind the bar lol,0,93,1
 We were on our honeymoon and they gave us an upgrade when they found out The staff were very friendly and made you feel special We were on the top floor with the roof top swimming pool right opposite Our room was big and bright with views of a little courtyard below A bath which is always a bonus and of course towelling robes Location perfect exit right onto the cathedral square A great place to spoil yourself for a special occasion We didn t have breakfast but it looked great ,0,93,1

 Once you make the check in they tell you that they have works at the 3rd floor and between 10 am till 8 pm it will be some noise Being honest with you It s impossible to take a nap and it so noisy I can t understand how they don t have a preference with the clients and invite to the breakfast or so I won t go back to the hotel and it is a pity as the location it s great but they are not honest with you,0,92,1

 It s not a 4 hotel it a good 3 Very good position in front of the hotel there is a tram station and just 3 5 minutes away is a metro station But you can also walk to the Duomo We asked a quiet room on an upper floor and we had nr 59 an excellent room with huge bad Everything was clean and nice The heater is working very good if you know to set it The breakfast is not so various but it s good quality ,0,91,1
 Decor is really different from other hotels so very refreshing and fun Service was excellent Our room was a little too hot and we couldn t work the controller but were silly enough not to ask Shame on us not them as they could have adjusted centrally The window did open though While a little out of centre the area is lovely and surrounding shops not geared for tourists so better value Also the tram from outside the door takes you straight to town Would definitely stay and recommend ,0,91,1
 We had booked a smaller room originally knowing it was just my husband myself and 11 year old daughter but realized it wouldn t work when we arrived and so for 20 Euro more a night we ended up in one of the Apartments with a washing machine mini kitchen living room and master upstairs It worked out great for us You can catch the trolley for 1 50 each way to the Duomo and back it s about a 15 minute ride Great Sushi restaurants in the area ,0,91,1
 What a great find From the moment we arrived we could tell we were going to enjoy our stay The receptionists were so friendly and helpful and throughout our stay they recommend restaurants booked reservations at restaurants suggested places to visit and gave gems of information to ensure we made the most of our time in Vienna They also went out their way to accommodate me with gluten free bread for breakfast freshly cooked bread rolls delicious All the staff throughout the hotel were incredibly friendly helpful and professional ,0,91,1

 We would recommend this property to any of our friends and we would certainly re book this hotel ourselves The location is perfect seconds from the wonderful museum quarter and the facilities are impeccable But it s the staff that make this hotel a winner The staff definitely go the extra mile to make sure Amsterdam feels like home They provide you with any assistance you may need from restaurant recommendations to wonderful Dutch treats Thanks to all but a special thanks to Thomas for making Amsterdam so memorable ,0,91,1

 The hotel was excellent While not in the very center of Amsterdam we found this to be an advantage because we didn t have to be in constant crowds It s only one tram stop away from Central Station and also an easy 10 minute walk The staff was wonderful and the included breakfast buffet well worth the money The concierge very helpful with tours tickets vouchers etc Also near the library where my husband wanted to do some research We booked a junior suite with a stunning view ,0,91,1
 The hotel is in a fantastic location less than 5 minutes walk from the Plaza Catalunya and just metres away from Las Ramblas yet still quiet inside The public areas of the hotel were modern and stylish but the guest bedrooms were a little dated but perfectly adequate Staff were very pleasant and eager to help It wasn t warm enough to use the swimming pool during my visit but would envisage it being great during the summer Would happily recommend the hotel and would certainly stay there again ,0,91,1
 I traveled with my little boy The hotel staff were extremely accommodating with all of our needs Including allowing us to use the hotel freezer for storing some of his baby food The room included a microwave and a fridge which again is very good when you have a child with you Overall it is a very good hotel and fantastic value for money Everything is so near by The public transport is easy to use and you can reach the center of the city within minutes by metro ,0,91,1
 The hotel is beautiful a with a tangible Dutch history throughout The staff are friendly andeager to help and when we raised an issue that we were not happy with it was dealt with it in an efficient and generous manner The facilities are excellent and all included in the price it is a pet hate of mine to have to pay extra for WiFi 25 Euros per day at the Renaissance and this is also included We will be back for Christmas shopping in December if not sooner ,0,91,1
 The rooms at the hotel were large and very clean The staff were marvellous and nothing was too much trouble for them We really appreciated the lovely breakfasts We were a group of 24 friends travelling together and found the large reception area a lovely place to meet that is if we weren t in the friendly bar The proximity to the station for the S7 to the airport was a real bonus as it was only 4 40 euros to travel there Altogether a lovely stay thank you ,0,91,1
 All staff were polite and friendly at all times not a single bad experience in the week we stayed here When we had a problem with the TV the technician was with us in minutes to resolve the issue and when we ordered room service the food was delivered in an incredibly short time and was absolutely delicious The hotel room was amazing the pictures on the website don t quite show how lovely it is and the massage shower was incredible Overall outstanding service at a lovely hotel ,0,91,1
 Excellent all the staff were first rate and all the extra details in the room were considered and thoughtful to make the stay a good one I was given a free upgrade to higher rating room and was very pleased with that thankyou As a solo traveller I have often been made to feel like a secondclass citizen when checking in to a hotel in complete contrast the staff here made me feel like I was genuinely welcome and the difference was really noticeable I highly recommend this hotel ,0,91,1
 Although breakfast is served in the main bar and not in a restaurant the choice is very good but moreover all of the staff of which there are many are very polite attentive and very efficient Before going to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall we ate at the Singapore restaurant The food was delicious and the service here was excellent too Parking at the hotel is very good value for money with plenty of spaces under cover Nothing was too much trouble at The Tara well done ,0,91,1

 Beautiful design rooms bathrooms hallways foyer everything is just really cool true Milan style friendly and helpful staff excellent value for money Location is very central right next to Duomo but it is of course very touristy some will appreciate it I did not care for it so much but chose the hotel mostly because of the design of the hotel and was not disappointed to say the least Overall excellent choice especially if in Milan for a short visit and need to be in the center of it ,0,91,1
 The hotel just state in front of the main train station very easy to go to the train station if you have many luggages There is few restaurant at the back of the hotel and some shopping center if you would like to buy some things The hotel reception is very helpful and super nice I must thanks for her super support me Shame I forgot to ask her name but she is Bulgarian lady and I hope her manager should be pound to have her in the team ,0,91,1
 What could you expect fro Marriott Good hotel Relatively good location Very close to the station and very quiet and safe around It takes about ten mins or even less to get to city centre if you get off at Universitat station The room was spacious and clean Pretty nice view from the room We had the double bedroom Didn t take any breakfast in the hotel as it was rather expensive 20 euros per person when you can spend about 15 euros only in the city for both ,0,91,1
 I recently booked this accommodation for a group of 11 on a stag do It s about 30 euros from the airport Linate by cab and a fifteen minute walk from the nearest Metro Romolo or the canal area at Navigli which is a beautiful area for meals and drinks A train in to the city centre is around 15 minutes and under 2 euros The staff were superb in particular the female receptionist and Andrea the room division manager They couldn t have been more accommodating of us ,0,91,1
 It was our second stay in Starhotels Ritz in the same week so this definitely speaks for itself I ve reviewed the hotels on my first booking but its always fair to do so on each occasion Staff was very helpful as the first time and location is very adequate for all the shopping access thatMilan offers Underground station is 4 5 minutes away which makes it also very convenient The rooms were super clean and since the expo was over we were given a larger than usual room ,0,91,1
 The bed and the room were very comfortable despite the small room size The high quality bath robe room slippers and complimentary drinks in the room s bar fridge were nice touches to the overall experience The hotel was also conveniently located opposite the Stadhouderskade tram stop for the No 4 tram line We would recommend Notting Hill for those who are keen to experience independent boutique hotels which are not associated to a major chain or hospitality brand and are more than capable to stand on their own ,0,91,1
 Having stayed at the Corinthia for a week we felt that it is an exceptional hotel and well worth the not insignificant cost Nothing is too much trouble and the staff are really friendly knowledgeable and helpful The room was very well equipped spacious and clean and the hotel s facilities are fantastic For such an opulent central london hotel it feels very personal and family run and this creates a very pleasant environment in which to stay We would definitely recommend it and look forward to staying again ,0,91,1
 Location to Wien Hbf Main station Room surprising well sound insulated from outside noise and given how busy the main road is and that I was facing that way I was not disturbed at all Also bedroom had an inner door which when shut cut down on noise in the corridor as well so a good night sleep was had Breakfast buffet is very varied I have stayed here some years ago before the days of Booking com so I had a good idea of what to expect anyway ,0,91,1

 The overall 3 day experience at the Select Hotel was outstanding The staff was superb with special thanks to Naomi the day manager The room hotel was absolutely the best we have experienced in Paris to date 7 visits over 12 years and a great value we have paid much more for less quality in the past Great view of square University of Paris and Cluny Museum and Notre Dame in the distance Room amenities were excellent We will return to this hotel in the future Great Hotel ,0,90,1

 Location right next to tube station Lancaster Gate and to Hyde Park Very quiet area Staff nice and helpful although when I asked what was more economic for the journey I had to make between private cab or a black cab I think the lady really knew what was cheaper but she wouldnt tell me Overall very good and economic especially bc it s London and it s not easy to find a nice clean and well located place unless you re willing to pay a super expensive price,0,90,1
 I really enjoyed the quality of the food within the restaurant I thought it was of a high standard Drinks were at a reasonable price also Most importantly to help with the reason of my stay I was very impressed that upon my request at reception about WiFi within my room the staff was able to help me without any extra cost added to my stay and was more than happy to do so All staff were very pleasant and happy Each staff member said good morning good evening,0,90,1

 This is a really lovely modern boutique hotel The staff are friendly and helpful but not at all intrusive The breakfasts are also very tasty with a good range of choices The rooms are quite small as other reviews say but very nicely decorated The beds are not small Do remember to ask if you need your bed to be made as a double we didn t realise at first that most rooms can be prepared as two singles or joined and prepared as one perfectly comfortable double ,0,90,1

 The hotel is currently going through a major renovation refit which meant you felt like you were in a bit of a building site The two main lifts didnt work so the very small max 2 person service lift was the only way of accessing the floors hence big queues But all this will no doubt be sorted and it will be very good when work completed Excellent staff very helpful and friendly I had room on 8th floor and was very clean and very comfortable Excellent Superb location,0,90,1
 Me and my girlfriend stayed overnight for her birthday recently and where absolutely amazed by this place It has a very subtle yet stylish decor It s location means it s on the doorstep of all the important local venues and points of interest yet it s set on its very own corner of the river The staff where amazing as I had a few request for my girlfriends birthday and they more then came through We both where very impressed and are already planning our next visit ,0,90,1

 A great location within a short walk to the metro or indeed not a long walk to many beautiful places to see eat and shop The staff were friendly and helpful making you feel comfortable from prior check in with an email 7 days before right through to check out Great little fitness room and hammam spa add to your escape We had a standard room and it was cosy but for the price it was perfectly good value and we would highly recommend for a couple travelling ,0,90,1
 The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was quite small There was a third bed in the room which was quite unnecessary and made it very cramped Our double bed was pushed up against the wall in one side which was also difficult The bathroom was okay but there was no bath mat or shower curtain so the floor got quite wet and was very slippery Continental Breakfast was good The hotel is in a quiet street so we could have the window open and sleep ,0,90,1
 Perfect location down a quiet side street close to restaurants and bars Excellent base for visiting all the major attractions in Paris being easy walking distance from 3 Metro stations Hotel room was a good size with a comfortable bed twin beds pushed together but absolutely fine and lovely decor Good size bathroom with excellent shower over the bath Clean and quiet The staff were very friendly and helpful We would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay there again if we were visiting Paris in the future ,0,90,1
 It was very convenient to two tube stops grocery bookstore British Museum British Library University of London and very walkable to areas around The double room was small but comfortable for one person It could have used a deep clean around the baseboards sill and doors but otherwise was well attended to daily The reception area could use some work as it doesn t leave a good impression but in the end it was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful I would stay there again ,0,90,1

 We have stayed here on many occasions over the years and have in our experience never had anything negative to report The hotel suits OUR requirements in all respects especially for the short breaks that we tend to take The hotel has undergone quite a physical up dating transformation over the recent past which has in our opinion been well managed with consideration for guests under what I m sure have been difficult circumstances We have ALWAYS found the management and staff pleasant efficient and very helpful indeed ,0,90,1
 Super quirky hotel with a very distinctive vibe Has a really great ambiance that s aimed more towards a younger visitor but fulfills all expectations whatever age you might be The atmosphere down in the reception area is amazing super cozy and inviting and the rooms are really comfy and snug as well The bar downstairs is one of the hotspots of Shoreditch LOTS of people and hubbub at night great music and generally a really inviting vibe Loved every minute and my go to hotel in London ,0,90,1
 The room was small but it had everything you needed in it so can t complain The location was fine it s a 5 minute walk to Baker St tube station The staff were grand friendly The breakfast was ok the sausages weren t nice they were those hotdog ones There s a nice room behind reception to chill out in watch TV there s free Nespreso coffee cookies Oh and the lift is very small myself and my husband fit in but it s a tight squeeze ,0,90,1
 The room was typical Parisian compact but beautifully furnished and the bed was of high quality and very comfortable The Reception team could not be faulted and we re always on hand to assist with restaurant bookings and directions Check in and out was efficient and bag storage was provided to allow us to enjoy our final day in the city It s location is perfect for a short break within easy walking distance of museums bars restaurants and shops We highly recommend for a short leisure break ,0,90,1

 The location of the hotel is one minute from the main central square in Barcelona Placa Catalunya where there are cafes restaurants shops the HOHO buses etc and yet the hotel rooms were very quiet The staff are fluent in English welcoming friendly and informative particularly Claudia who went out of her way to assist and deal with all questions The buffet breakfast was superb The rooms and public spaces were all spotlessly clean and the AC worked which is important as August is very hot in Barcelona ,0,90,1
 We were totally satisfied with our stay The location was excellent just off La Rambla but in a quiet lane We felt totally safe walking around at all hours and there was easy access to the subway taxis and the hop on hop off bus main terminal The staff were incredibly helpful and the breakfasts have us extensive choices and excellent quality The outdoor seating area at the hotel was a particular favourite especially when we bought a simple meal for dinner and ate it at the hotel ,0,90,1

 This hotel has immaculate style and presentation They have obviously spent a lot of money on the fit out and design You get to choose a sweet AND savoury option for the included breakfast served with great coffee juice Didn t eat dinner there but the menu looked fantastic All staff restaurant reception housekeeping were happy informative friendly The bed pillows were super comfy and rooms well stocked with lovely toiletries I needed an iron and reception organised for one to be delivered to my room within minutes ,0,90,1
 The airport shuttle bus goes past the hotel It was a very hot day when we arrived and the aircon was excellent We were on the 7th floor and we had a balcony that overlooked the Gran Via but it wasn t noisy because there were double doors There is a small pool upstairs and an area to sit The staff were very helpful and there are lots of places nearby to eat and the bus stop to return to the airport is only a short walk away ,0,90,1
 The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous But we were extremely lucky The front desk upgraded us to a Junior suite Wow It was wonderful And we so appreciated it He saw that we were staying for a while and upgraded us because he had space That s pretty darn fantastic Many hotels do not let the front desk make those kinds of decisions It was a great decision And the conceige was always very helpful And everyone welcomed us and acknowledged us when we came and went Bravo ,0,90,1
 The bed was one of the comfiest hotel beds I ve stayed in and I ve been to a fair few Staff were very attentive and spoke great English and very helpful in helping tourists navigate their way around Great facilities and I honestly couldn t recommend this hotel more Such a great location and room Brilliant if it s your first time to Amsterdam tram just down the road and can purchase tickets at reception close to city centre and trams running until 12am back to hotel ,0,90,1
 The bed was so comfy and the decor in our room was very stylish The hotel bar was cheap so good for pre drinks and we were pointed in the direction of a lovely traditional Austrian restaurant top of the road then round the corner Also 10 minutes walk to the underground so not long from centre of Vienna at all We didn t bother with breakfast because at 15 Euro a head we could get it cheaper elsewhere but overall this hotel was great value for money ,0,90,1
 We were visiting for our second visit and last time travelled as a family with children This time we were there for the London marathon and were impressed that they had gone out of their way to accommodate the runners with extras in the room and a special menu laid on There are lots of pubs shops and restaurants within walking distance and very close to the Tube station Views from the park are amazing Very happy with our stay and will be visiting again Reasonably priced accommodation ,0,90,1
 We had a great time staying at the 25 hours It was the first city break we had attempted with our young son and the hotel set a cot up in our room and provided us with a high chair when we ate in the restaurant We loved all the quirky details and the panoramic view from the rooftop bar We had a studio which was spacious and came with a kitchen including microwave The hotel was well situated and we were able to walk to most places ,0,90,1

 Very friendly and helpful staff I especially liked the greeter role which made the customer journey in the hotel effective For London measures the room was quite large with an extra sofa bed for our daughter The food in the restaurant was really good at very good price quality ration We will surely return to Pullman on our next visit to London Close to St Pancras station allowed us to drop off luggage on our first day very easily and continue our trip to the city ,0,88,1
 The attentiveness of the staff when I had made a special request was really something else I was leaving for 3 months so I asked them to just do a simple request for when I came into the room with my boyfriend Instead they called me up and asked me what he liked ended up making delicious brownies for us Absolutely amazing what they did for us Its quite simply put that the Pullman is one of the rare hotels that really cares for its customers ,0,88,1
 Great hotel at a great location This hotel is really worth its money You are a 3 minute walk away of two Metro stations and a short walk of the Champ de Mars park The stuff is also really kind and helpful The only thing which isn t that convenient is that there is no restaurant in the hotel itself But there are plenty of restaurants next door There s also a small Carrefour on the other side of the street which has all you need ,0,88,1
 I thoroughly enjoyed my one night stay at the Holiday Inn The staff were very warm friendly and helpful As I arrived on an early morning flight the staff were helpful with luggage storage and providing an earlier check in The room was bright spacious I chose this hotel due to it s proximity to the Gare de Lyon and my onward travels It was even closer to the station than I had expected which made it very easy to catch the TGV the next day ,0,88,1
 So glad we chose 11 Cadogan Gardens for a very quick trip to London The staff were wonderful and nothing was ever too much trouble Very importantly our bed was a true king size and extremely comfortable The bathroom was a tad on the squeezy side but that is England We got used to it and found it charming The location is perfect walking distance to Sloane Square tube station and lots of fantastic restaurants nearby I really couldn t fault it and would highly recommend ,0,88,1

 Hotel is beautiful extremely stylish with excellent facilities the spa is a very nice feature for the price The rooms are very spacious and clean with the nice little touches with the lighting and gadgets Breakfast was delicious and all freshly cooked so no limp eggs or bacon all very tasty ingredients too Staff were also very pleasant and accommodating Great location with a sainsburys lock next door and 2 minutes to the train and lots of nice bars places to eat Will definitely stay again ,0,88,1
 The free room upgrade was great I have always considered all accommodation as simply being somewhere to lay your head But the river view was amazing watching the world come to life at 5am was absolutely beautiful and so appreciated I ve definitely been converted now All front of house staff were polite attentive and approachable Location wise the hotel is about a 10 15 minute walk from Waterloo Station just the other side of the Lambeth bridge so Central London is easily within walking distance ,0,88,1
 The view of the Eiffel tower from our balcony was AMAZING In fact the pics on the website don t even do it justice The hotel should really post better pics of the view would attract more people I think I m big on spacious balconies and amazing views so I was not disappointed They should definitely advertise better pics of it The beds were comfy shower was big having a bar downstairs was nice We didn t eat at the restaurant but it looked amazing ,0,88,1
 Wonderful helpful staff and really efficient cleaning service We went down to breakfast at 9am and by 10am when we returned to our room it was spotless I recommend paying that little bit extra for a room with an Eiffel Tower view because it really made the trip special Check in and check out was fast and simple and the staff all spoke perfect English The breakfast was buffet style and offered a lot of choice and it never seemed rushed or crowded An excellent stay ,0,88,1

 I travel a lot on business The most important factors while choosing a hotel for myself are location lack of noise comfort I have no complaints My room was comfortable spacious spotless I could concentrate on my work as there was hardly any noise Nespresso coffee machine was an extra bonus I could watch TV through the glass wall while having a bath Excellent location hidden away but at the same time very close to the shops Hyde Park tube station I highly recommend this hotel ,0,88,1
 Our stay at the hotel was very nice We were a group of eight people travelling to have a nice time together in London before Christmas The hotel has the best location in the city center in walking distance from Covent Garden Oxford Street and China Town for example The hotels bar and restaurant was very nice and the food and cocktails superb Rooms were very clean and the all the employees very nice and helpful Concierge was very helpful and made our trip more special ,0,88,1
 This is reasonabley priced Hotel in a beautiful Georgian building in Kensington overlooking a beautiful park The rooms are all a little bit exotic and the breakfast area is a delight in a glass and solid wood conservatory The service and attention to detail from the staff is great I have stayed twice now and nothing is too much trouble There are a great selection of restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the tube is also very close to hand I will definately stay again ,0,88,1
 We travelled to London for our anniversary and chose the Mondrian as it was highly rated On arrival at the hotel we had a small problem with the initial room The manager on duty Shahnawaz Khan was very quick to remedy the problem and provided us with exceptional service making this one of the most memorable hotel experiences we had Our room was changed and we were also treated to cocktails and champaign to apologize for the initial problem The Mondrian has certainly exceeded our expectations ,0,88,1
 Staff were extremely welcoming polite and helpful I was riding in the Prudential 100 on Sunday 2nd August so was not around on the Sunday morning to check out with my wife I was therefore most impressed that one member of staff took the time to carry our bag s to our car in the car park over the road great service We were also greeted with a welcome drink prior to checking in at reception Arrangements for bike storage were also excellent and very secure ,0,88,1
 Great speed of service with likeable staff that dos everything to make the stay comfortable Small caramels before sleeping left on the bed Not what you expect from a 4 hotel Clarins bath products also a nice surprise Bathrobe and slippers too Not what you expect for a 4 hotel so well done For the price it really is good value for money in a central location in Paris just off Place Vendome Amazing Breakfast was also sufficient with juices fruit hot etc A decent spread ,0,88,1
 A great welcome and smiles at check in On arrival there was a card box of chocolates and a lovely bottle of wine were in my room to congratulate me on my birthday It was totally unexpected what a wonderful surprise The bed linen was spotless and the room and bathroom scored 10 10 for cleanliness The swimming pool was of an ambient temperature available from 7am until 22pm so convenient I would most definitely recommend The Henry VIII Hotel and shall most certainly stay again ,0,88,1
 We stayed for 7 nights It is a perfect location with 2 tube stations and a train station very close by with access to many tube lines The staff were great and their facilities are very good The only thing is that the room is a bit small but it is well equipped with modern finish They also provided a free mobile with data internet access and free calls to the uk This was very helpful when we needed to refer to google maps for directions ,0,88,1
 Area was great very close to good restaurants grocery shops and cafes Vibrant area but the room was quiet top floor Room had a balcony with table and chairs which was a nice bonus and actually made the room feel bigger I feel the price of the hotel considering the rest of Paris was very fair Restaurant in the hotel does amazing food but was a bit pricy enough Although all of paris is pricy so I m being over critical there It was all awesome ,0,88,1
 The very cheery and helpful receptionist made our short stay very enjoyable She went out of her way to advise us regarding timetables and routes and we came away with a smile The hotel is small but cosy The rooms are again small but very well laid out and very comfortable and clean Overlooking the garden at the rear of the property was an added bonus Breakfast was buffet with choices and very adequate We would definitely use again and hopefully see the lovely staff again ,0,88,1
 Our room was lovely until the toilet broke it constantly flushed itself we reported the problem to staff who basically told us there was nothing they could do Once we d fallen asleep a board containing electricals dropped causing a loud bang exposing plugs belonging to the TV hairdryer etc which in turn woke us up and to top it off the milk for the complimentary coffee tea was rotten We eventually managed to change rooms we had no problems as all in the second room ,0,88,1
 The proximity of the hotel to Wembley Stadium as we were there solely for the Rugby World Cup New Zealand v Argentina As we were staying at the hotel after the match we decided to eat at there The restaurant was packed with supporters from the match all wanting to eat and drink There was only one waitress taking orders clearing tables serving food Her name was Mirela from Romania and she was a STAR She kept everyone happy and always a smile on her face ,0,88,1
 Very nice hotel located in the heart of London City A lot of restaurants around like famous Burger ad Lobster which is just in from of hotel and Duck and Waffle in some 400 meters walk Metro station is also in some 3 minutes walk very convenient just taking a central line and going to Oxford street for shopping or any other place Hotel itself is very nice and quiet good breakfasts very clean and room service works very well Considering the location price is OK ,0,88,1
 Our room was very comfortable and tastefully decorated with soft colours The bed was really good and enough large for two persons Dorsett hotel is situated at a large park and on the other side around a few corners there is a very interesting long Shepherd s Bush Market with lots of choice ordinary London souvenirs at cheaper price clothes fabrics household wares food Anything If you have 2 hours time go through it before other shopping Rest of shopping nearby at westfield luxury shopping centres ,0,88,1
 The staff were all really lovely helpful and efficient My husband and I felt really welcomed and looked after The main thing that was important to us was the nearness of the hotel to the Queens Theatre where we had tickets for Les Miserables We came out of the theatre after the performance and were in our warm room less than five minutes later perfect All the room facilities were just right The bathroom in particular was lovely with under floor heating and a roomy shower ,0,88,1
 Great boutique luxury hotel in a perfect location for folks who like to walk a city My kids are teenagers and were perfectly happy with this hotel but little kids would likely not find much to their liking No kiddie facilities or programs in other words I would recommend this hotel unreservedly to any business or leisure traveler looking for something small and a bit out of the way it s tucked into a cul de sac while still being near to all the good stuff ,0,88,1
 The staff were very friendly Anybody booking a hotel room in central London should manage their expectations of the size of room they are going to get The room here was Bijou but was adequate for my purposes Room was saved by having rainfall shower rather than a bath and by having a queen bed rather than a full size double but since I was travelling alone this was fine The hotel is within walking distance of Pimlico tube and in a very nice area of London,0,88,1
 Bed was so comfortable Nice quiet room surprising as it was street level Accommodating for late checkout Great location without stupid pricing Would definitely go back we live in London but booked this hotel for an holiday evening as we had a function in Russell Square it was such a lovely stay that even though I had to go back to work in London for a night shift the day of departure I felt as if I had actually been on holiday Highest compliments as such ,0,88,1
 The staff was very knowledgeable and very helpful They answered our endless questions with patience I also loved that the hotel is located a few feet away from the subway The room was really small but it looks exactly like the picture There are restaurants close by The breakfast is a little pricey but there is an amazing bakery right around the corner from the hotel It is not a luxury hotel but I am happy I chose Faubourg 88 and I would stay there again ,0,88,1
 This small hotel is full of character Ask for the book about it s history Rooms are small but have everything you need the shower even had Jacuzzi jets The hotel is just south of the river from Notre Dame It is convenient to the metro However much of Paris is within walking distance The nearby street St Andre des Artes has almost every choice of eating places you can imagine The manager and his staff did everything they could to ensure we enjoyed our stay ,0,88,1
 The room was brilliant Everything was nicely decorated and the room felt spacious We had an amazing view of the canal too The hotel was in an ideal location for us about a 25 minute walk from the hub of the city there is a bus stop right next to the hotel which takes you to Zuid station or Amstel station in a few minutes Loved the tv the fridge was handy and the free hotel shuttle to the airport was great Overall it was fab ,0,88,1
 Great hospitality a little far from tourist city center but still close enough using Tram 5 5 min walk from hotel 15 min ride to Liedsplien Clean rooms good and warm air con Breakfast was unfortunately not included nor there was a kitchen in the room but we ate a small breakfast of yughourt and oatmeal before heading out each day Nice fitness room no pool Great internet lounge and Wifi reception throughout hotel Very recommended for all but more for business than family vacation hotel ,0,88,1
 Lovely hotel Perfect for a short break Rooms were lovely very comfortable and clean Food was lovely too The only thing was it was a bit out of the way from the city centre It was about a 10 minute walk to the tram and then about 20 minute to half an hour journey on the tram depending on where you wanted to go This being said I think I will stay here again and would have no hesitation in recommending it too friends and family ,0,88,1
 Excellent location walking distance to all the main sites and shopping areas in Barcelona The hotel was lovely room and bathroom were spacious and we loved the rooftop bar in the evenings We didn t arrive to check in until after midnight and were greeted by a lovely guy on reception with no issues similarly they were more than happy to look after our bags for the day as we didn t fly out until late I d definitely recommend this hotel if you are visiting ,0,88,1
 Nice hotel 5 min walk from Cayaluna Metro statio easy to find and a 10 min walk from the Barcelona Stadium on the same metro line as the Sagrada Familliar so overall good location out of the centre but very easily to access Hotel was nice although spa is a little strict ensure you are armed with flip flops or you will have to buy disposable ones at 3 a pair plus must take own towels or 10 to hire them dont forget hair band either ,0,88,1
 My friend and I decided to stay over in London after a 14 day tour of Europe We chose Thistle Euston because it was affordable The staff from Reception to dining room provided excellent service and went out of their way to accommodate our every request The breakfast selection was wide and varied My colleague and I have recommended Thistle Euston to our friends and it will definitely be our first choice when we visit London again Thanks for a truly wonderful end to our vacation ,0,88,1
 I had an amazing experience with the staff of Enterprise even before I arrived thanks to Mrs Elisa and everyone involved we were able to prepare a surprise for our friends who arrived earlier than us If I travel to Milan again I will book a room at Enterprise for sure The hotel is not far away from the centre easy to reach by tram and not so expensive by taxi either The bed was great clean sheets clean room and bathroom overall a 4 experience ,0,88,1
 The location was brilliant Slightly out of the buzz but that is what we liked as it was only a short walk We asked for a room at the back of the hotel so as it was more quiet and they accepted our request What can we say about the shower bathroom apart from luxury The shower was big enough for about 4 people The staff were very helpful and told us the directions to the main tourist places Absolutely fantastic hotel would definitely come back ,0,88,1
 Although I paid for WiFi initially the money was returned as I joined the Marriott club Always enjoy this hotel as great location for Eurostar and visiting London and the building is lovely We have not yet stayed in the old part as it is very pricey although one day I would love to do so We always have a look at the lovely staircase when we are there However it has always been very comfortable in the Barlow and everything is at a high standard ,0,88,1
 From Check In to Check Out the staff couldn t have been more helpful or welcoming It what is obviously a hotel that mainly deals with Business people it was fantastic to have a young child and feel like we were just as welcome Close to the station and comfortable walk to the museum quarter and some lovely parks The food and service in the Manhattan Bar was particularly good as was the morning breakfast team Providing special toiletries for children was a nice touch too ,0,88,1
 Old England charm the rooms are on the small side but functional clean and comfortable There are a number of cozy living areas in the hotel that give an at home feel to the place Cocktails in the evening in front of the fireplace at the George Bar were nice breakfast and tea were good but not on the cheap side Location is optimum very central and practical yet the street itself is very quiet We ll definitively be coming back on our next London trip ,0,88,1

 I think the criticisms of the hotel are ridiculous It s great value excellent service and unbeatable convenience The half board option is included in the room rate The breakfast is above par The dinner is ok but what would the miserable complainers be paying outside A minimum of 18 euros for wine and a primi Sample your amazing Italian food for lunch But really this hotel offers excellent value Those who say otherwise are inexperienced travelers ,0,79,1
 Hotel had a beautiful view of Central Station perfect location to travel anywhere Great value for the price the room was beautiful and had all the amenities a traveler could ask for Breakfast was great but if you don t like it there are several cafes within walking distance They let you check your bags after your checkout so you an travel all day freely and it is right next to the bus stop for the airport ,0,79,1

 design of room was perfect but there is a smell at room which is bad Hotel need to solve this problem not so close to city centre from La Rambla it costs 8 10 euro by taxi if you traveling 2 3 people it is not a big value by walking 15 20 minutes to La sagrada familia Breakfast was perfect but extra I wish I could have this breakfast included in room price that i pay ,0,79,1
 Excellent quality for the money Nice people Because the hotel was not available for the requested early check in they upgraded us to an apartment at same cost It is beautiful to walk in the Grinzing area or to take the tram 38 for just 20 minutes trip to the city center I recommend the location for everybody wanting to have busy days in the city center and relaxed evenings uphill to the traditional restaurants and wineries ,0,79,1

 The hotel is in the El Born district and close to good restaurants etc but it is still a seedy area and you have to be on your guard for pickpockets etc We did not feel safe unless walking with our group of friends The staff were helpful and the room facilities comfortable Close enough to some of the attractions especially the hop on hop off bus ,0,69,1

 Wonderful central hotel Rooms small but adequate clean and well maintained I stayed with a group of 9 family members we were all located on the same floor and all rooms had either a view of Tower Bridge or St Katherine Dock The only slight negative point was the slowness of the lifts A great place to stay if you are in London for a short break ,0,69,1
 Great location Friendly staff with excellent command of English We had asked for a quiet room and we got it What really touched us was when our 3 year old daughter came down with a virus and I can not tell you how helpful and caring the staff were The hotel maid even left a gift for her to cheer her up We ll definitly go back ,0,69,1

 The hotel was centrally located in downtown Vienna Easy walking distance to many of the sights and the U Bahn stations There is construction going on across the street from the hotel resulting in increased noise levels in the hotel room during working hours 0900 1800 However the hotel recognized this inconvenience and provided earplugs in the room as well as 50 off at the hotel bar ,0,69,1
 I thought the room was beautifully decorated gold textured fabric covered walls spotlessly clean and fairly large by European standards I thought the helpfulness of staff particularly Viviana who was able to lend me an adaptor for my electrical devices and arrange a snack for me while I waited a very short while for my room preparation since I had arrived exceptionally early and Nicolas was outstanding ,0,69,1
 We select this hotel because based on price and location everything was as promised very clean rooms as in the pictures good breakfast perfect location WiFi fine Recommended Just one little thing it s not easy to get there we arrive to Milano Centrale it s very close but there s no appropiate signs of the hotel so it s a little though to find the address ,0,69,1

 Great price a 10 minutes walk from Stephanplatz For all those going with a car Park it in front of the hotel until you unpack ask the staff for a parking authorisation and find a parking spot around the hotel lots of parking places We stayed the night so we preferred paying for a spot nearby than going to a public parking that s free of charge ,0,69,1

 Hotel Russell is my preferred hotel in London The Piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel Russell station and then you are in the central part of London close to the British Museum and many historic sites The hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations The only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan ,0,68,1
