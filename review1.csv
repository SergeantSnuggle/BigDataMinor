An experience to be repeated .,We went for a late lunch and we were amazed by the quality and presentation of the food. The glamour of the hotel and restaurant and the kindness and sympathy of Roland and Hans. The lobster is to die for. We finished our meal convinced that we will soon be back.,50
Afternoon tea disappointing,"The afternoon tea is below standard. First, all tables are served at the same time for each of the 4 “courses”, which takes way too much time between the courses - we ended up being there for more than 3 hours. A lot for finger food and tea. The pairing of different teas for each round is nice, just a pity that it was sometimes luke warm. Sandwiches were average despite the fancy description (salmon yuzu hardly tasted of yuzu and others were very simple). The pastries were ok but the chocolate rocher was nothing more than a larger Ferrero Rocher. Finally the scones were very small, very dry, and there was plain cream instead of clotted cream. The lemon curd was nice though. We have high standards perhaps, but this is not what one would expect from a high tea, especially at this",30
bad value for money,"i am rating this hotel with 2+ but, do not misunderstand me, it is a good hotel. historic building, well maintained, elegant, clean... however... i did not find a good value for money. to start, the location is not the best in amsterdam, far from the dam platz and the main museums (half an hour walking to any of these points). the porter at the entrance by the day when we arrivedwas behaving like a policeman in an alcohol control by the manners in which he was asking for the vaccination proof. with an exception, the receptionists did not reach the level either. the concierge who borught the luggage to the room had no interest to explain anything about the room features. guests were allowed to refrain from using their face masks inside the hotel. the room was ok, clean",20
Excellent place to stay,"The hotel is located on the Amstel river in a pleasantly quiet and beautiful neighborhood. Sleep quality is very satisfying. It is a historic building: its exterior appearance and the hall are really impressive. Rooms are spacious, clean, well-appointed and well-equipped, clearly tilted toward a classic, French-like style. Reception and service are very attentive and kind, just what you would expect in such an establishment. Food at the restaurant is very good (I did not try breakfast though). In sum, a great experience. Only two bones to pick: the duvet on my king bed was laid in an odd way, because it did not cover the whole surface of the bed (I was alone, so I didn't ask Housekeeping to solve the problem); as it happens very often, the food and drink voucher for Ambassadors",50
"Great tea and food, but feels like I'm on an assembly line",Overall we had a good experience. We do feel that this is one of the more mass products from the hotel. For instance we arrived 30 minutes early. The person at the reception said that this was no problem and that we could wait in the lobby. Obviously waiting for 30 minutes in a lobby does not make a lot of sense on a sunny day. Especially when you consider the terrace was quite empty. It adds to the feeling that the afternoon tea group is really something separate from the 'real' hotel guests. You also notice this when the entire group that is coming for the tea is waiting together and is only seated at exactly 16:00. After this a runbook or playbook is done which is identical for everyone. You get really good tea with a nice background story. The tea is paired quite well,30
Amazing stay,"Everything was great, definitely one of the best hotels in Europe! Very spacious rooms and very clean! The breakfast was also incredible, unfortunately there is no buffet but the À la carte menu has a very good choice. The staff was friendly and polite especially the staff at breakfast! They have also a very good spa center whit sauna and steam bath.",50
High Tea - dissapointed,"I fully agree with the review of Marcel: we too were so excited to go and have a high tea at the Amstel Hotel! But such a shame: we expected high standard and a real genuine high/afternoon tea, but we were surprised to have poke bowl and cheviche as part of the bites, the cakes looked lovely but were too small and we expected to have unlimited access to tea in teapots: we were served 4 small cups of tea each. For 50,- euros per person we expect quality in the way you think you will get at the famous Amstel Hotel..... The waiters/waitresses did their job well, only good things to say about them. They offered to take picture of our group and we could ask for more information about the tea served. I would recommend to do some research in high class afternoon tea's which are served",20
Disappointing high tea experience,"We are Dutch, living in Amsterdam. The Amstel hotel is one of the most outstanding hotels in town.... they said... Visiting the Amstel hotel was on our list for many years. Yesterday we experienced the Amstel with their high tea afternoon special. The building is amazing on the outside, the inside spiegelzaal is old fashioned and very outdated. It needs a lot of renovation. The paint hangs loose on the walls, the used colour pattern is of the beginning of the 90's. Nice if you're of old age but not compelling at all to anymore younger than 75... The teas were nice. The starter was unworthy of the name and fame of the Amstel. It was average to okay. The breads were standard. Nothing special. The sweets were fine. The only part that was as expected to get at the Amstel hotel.",30
Amstel Afternoon tea,"What a delightful afternoon we had with a group of 4. We enjoyed every aspect, the spiegelzaal, the impeccable gentle caring service, the divine combination of teas and food. In dutch we would say, het is een aanrader.",50
Public spaces are lovely. Room overlooking the river: Shabby!,"Beautiful building well appointed in public areas, Excellent service. Friendly staff. Attentive to pet requirements. But King Room 306 river view is shabby at best. Stains on curtains, worn rug with stains. Molding in bathroom rotting. Paint worn off wardrobe door. A delightful location with excellent restaurant and beautiful bar and pool at river level.But value for money seriously insulted. I will return for the public spaces but cannot recommend the hotel for overnight.",20
Lovely location,"We had dinner outside with friends just so close to the river. The location is great, food is very good. It was just a little bit dark as there were no candles or light on the table. Anyway it is worth it. I would definitely suggest it.",40
Best InterContinental in Europe with outstanding service,"4th stay at the Amstel Hotel: the grandeur and beauty of the building remain. Even if the Covid has changed some details: seated check in, beautiful lounges removed and plexiglass walls, the welcome is still the best in Europe. And the team shows great professionalism, so that the customer does not suffer from the Covid. The IHG CLEAN protocol is perfect. InterContinental remains the only chain with LHW to maintain a real level of recognition for its Ambassador members. With my Platinum status I received a double upgrade to an executive river view suite. The Whaooooooo effect was immediate upon discovering the rest. Everything is magnificent, the common areas, restaurants and terrace on the Amstel river. All the staff are very friendly and cheerful. Room service (diner and",50
Wonderful place to stay,We stayed for two nights here. Breakfast was very enjoyable with an excellent service. The bar location was inside as well as outside with a wonderful river view (as well valid for the breakfast area). The service was excellent here as well. The reception was a little understaffed. The doorman and the concierge were very helpful and gave good recommendations and support,50
One of the very best afternoon thee in Amsterdam,"This is indeed one of my favorite from the best afternoon thee places in Amsterdam. Wonderful location near the river, nice people and very good food as well. For one driving, easy parking with enough room especially for Amsterdam.",50
High tea,"I went to the amstel hotel for an afternoon high tea with a friend. The atmosphere is great and the staff very friendly. The food didn’t impress us much.. The sandwiches didn’t have an interesting flavor or touch to it which I’d have expected from the Amstel hotel. Yet, the sweet course was lovely and very tasty. The teas were nice and I loved the addition of an iced tea.",30
A grand hotel,"As I’ve mentioned before, the hotel is very grand. It’s like a palace. The service is pretty good! People there treat us like royals. The location is convenient, it’s in the two roads and one riverside! Such an atmosphere by the river!",40
"Nightmare check-in, Everything else is great","I loved my stay at this hotel. The location is great, right beside the amstel river with a great view of it, the property is very beautiful and the staff were professional. The room is spacious and comfortable. The breakfast is fine. Everything went great except the check-in process which was very bad as they asked for a huge deposit (150 euros for every day of my stay) and they did not accept deposit in a different currency (i carried USD). I stayed at another 5 stars hotel in Amsterdam and paid only 50 euros a day as deposit. I am not sure how much is the normal deposit and why did they ask me for such a huge amount?. I had to pay the deposit using credit card, the refund toke a while to process and this disrupted the rest of my travel. I also think that they asked other",30
Incredible stay,We booked in for one night as a special treat and special it was... Everything from start to finish was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff couldn’t be more friendly and helpful.. special thanks must go to Kimberley who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was simply perfect..she is an absolute asset to this wonderful historic hotel. I would recommend it to anyone in a heart beat.,50
Amazing stay but is it worth the money....,"We finally had a excuse to stay at the Amstel Hotel after been visiting often when we lived in Amsterdam we never had a hotel stay. There are some attention for details needed for a 5 star hotel, for example upon arrival no bell boy or porter outside to assist us with the car and the luggage, rooms are nice but honestly price per night average 650 Euro is it worth.. not really.. there are better hotels for a better price to stay to be honest. Breakfast was great, not cheap but with a champagne your day starts great with the view over the canals and very attentive staff which serve you all what you need. all over a good experience and certainly te recommend if you have a big wallet to spend.",40
"Best high tea in the city, without a doubt!",Loved the high tea so much. Just amazing and the food was just the best. I loved that the tea's were matching the different courses as well and because I was celebrating my friends and mine birthday they did something nice for that too! I will be back soon for sure.,50
Relaxing spa stay,"Large rooms over looking peaceful side of the city. Short distance away from the central town. Very personnel check in, with lovely touches being offered tea and small cakes. Concierge were very swift on taking the bags to the room. Our favourite part of the hotel was the spa. Very peaceful, quite and overlooking the river. The facilities were great specially the cooling well and whirlpool was our favourite. Also, was a great spot on the side of the pool to read on the loungers.",50
Great use of IHG points,"We stayed here in December on my IHG points for 2 nights, in 2 rooms and did not pay a dime. When we told waiters/waitresses where we were staying they were impressed. My wife and I got upgraded to a large suite based on my IHG status which included a shower and a tub. The water flew out of the facet at the sink but at least there was a written warning of as much. We did not eat at the hotel or make use of the pool but it looked pretty awesome. We were able to walk from the hotel to the Heineken factory for a tour and over to the Jordaan and red light district. It was a quiet location at night, the beds were comfortable and we could walk everywhere we wanted to go.",50
Nice old style hotel on Amsterdam river,We went for a business event. The hotel location is nice with beautiful view on the window. Meeting rooms are impressive but very old style. Also my room was very spacious but very classic. Food was ok. International style. Check-in was very low. Personnel took a very long-time to insert my credit card.,40
Best breakfast ever!,"Having lived in Amsterdam, I'd seen the hotel all the time. But never had a reason to visit. Now that I had to visit Amsterdam, I knew I had to try the Amstel Hotel. It did not disappoint :) The setting is amazing and the room [Junior suite] was large with an amazing view over the river. Very comfortable bed and a large and luxurious shower and bath. Staff was friendly, check-in and out were excellent. The best part though was breakfast. I love a la carte breakfast ;) Super friendly staff and since it was a Monday morning, it was really quiet and we could sit at the window overlooking the Amstel. Need to go to Amsterdam a few times in the coming weeks. I'll be at the Amstel Hotel :)",50
"Disappointing, poor value, poor service high tea","After quite a few high teas in Amsterdam - The Duchess at the W, the Waldorf etc, and at Hotel des Indes in The Hague (my favourite), my husband booked the Amstel as a treat for my birthday this past weekend. Although not all the others have been good this was the most disappointing from the poor welcome at the beginning to the 184 euro bill at the end. We opted for their royal high tea which didn’t seem any different to any other. First course was a mini quiche and a sort of sausage salad, second course I cannot remember at all it was so nondescript and the sweets selection included a scone and a few pastries. The scone was actually good, although the lemon curd that came with it was too runny. If this selection had been served by knowledgeable staff they could have (maybe)",20
Tea at InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam,"A luxury and tasty experience. Taken by my daughter, me and my wife went to this luxury hotel for tea. The service, the quality of the food as well the variety of teas, was a greatful experience. Well, seeing the price paid, is not for everybody.",50
"Hotel is dated, we ended our stay early due to disappointing experience","Upon arrival at 5pm we had to wait 45 minutes before we could access our room, no reason was given. We were booked into a room much smaller than we'd paid for, with a side view, not river as expected. Staff seem quite disorganised and the impression is that this hotel was once grand and luxurious, but has not been maintained. Wallpaper is discoloured, carpets old and fraying, and in the hallway outside our room there was an area sectioned off with tape & traffic cones. It's certainly not the sort of ambience you'd expect from a 5 star property. Sadly we left after the 1st night and moved to a different hotel for the remainder of our stay. On the positives, the manager Pascale was genuinely apologetic for the mistakes and experience and accommodated our early departure. This",30
Should not have returned....,"I stayed here again for work, and I am not surprised that it hasn’t changed from my last impression. Nice, traditionally-appointed plush rooms. Still astounded by the staff. For eg, asked for some eggs and bacon at breakfast, and they sent an older waiter who frowned at me and tell me that its not possible, due to unclear reasons. I was also sitting at a table near the those napkin counters and noticed the staff hung around there, chit-chatting and laughing loudly, and not attending to diners. Needs a total change-over in staff. Why did I return?",20
Luxurious,"It was luxurious. While we were checking in, we were offered champagne while waiting for our key card. You don’t stand in line while waiting but seated. The room was very large. We opened our 4 luggages but still we could walk around with ease. Of course the bed, the couch were impressively decorated. The bathroom was also large. Different division for the shower, another for the bath tub and another room for the toilet. The racks which held your towels in the bathroom were heated. Of course, it was very expensive. Pets are allowed. Well, i know dogs were allowed because there were guests there with their dogs. They even have special menu for your dog. We also had a beautiful view from our window. If you have much to spend on a hotel, this is the place to be.",50
Wonderful room and stay,"As an Ambassador, we were upgraded to a canal view room and got a 4pm late checkout. Room was beautiful and tastefully appointed. Special thanks to Rick at check in and Tim, at the concierge desk. Both were extremely helpful and pleasant to deal with. We had a lovely stay.",50
Best hotel I have had the pleasure to stay at.,"I have been traveling for over 50 years and my hotel stays have ranged from Motel 6 and mom and pop to 5 star hotels. To say this is the best I have ever stayed at is saying something. From the welcome from to the doorman on arrival to the goodbye from the doorman on departure everything is perfect. The staff is attentive and helpful. From the welcome card and the cookies, the turndown service to the great bath amenities are all top notch. I paid for my stay with points and was treated tremendously. I only wish I would have tried to ask for an upgrade. We got an room across the elevator, but we never heard any noise. Saying that the room was awesome. A cheaper breakfast option would have been great but one can't have everything in life. The burger I did have was well worth the",50
Fantastic stay,"I stayed at the International Amstel with my wife for 6 days in October this year. For a quick review: fantastic location. Exceptional staff who clearly are, in the main, career service industry professionals. The rooms are lovely. The food and drink are not to be missed. We'll be back! Longer review: Before writing this review I gave a little consideration to the common complaints made by other reviewers: fashion of the rooms (being quite dated), and (oddly enough) breakfast service. The hotel is well placed, close to the tourist areas of Amstersam and well connected by a nearby metro and tram stations. The service at the hotel was of a very high standard. We had breakfast, dinner, brunch, used the concierge service a number of times, and rented one of the canal boats. All",50
Beautiful building but poor service,"At check-in, there was only one of service staff at the counter, and she was talking on the phone. I just stood there waiting for her to finish talking. The breakfast service staff is not enough. Everyone is very busy. It is difficult to find a waiter to service. After I finish breakfast , I had to proactively ask for the bill. After signing the bill, I can't find the waiter. At the time of check-out, the bill was automatically deducted from my credit card, but I was not asked if I would use Euro or Taiwan Dollar . The counter used DCC with a Taiwanese currency deduction, which made me pay more.",20
Awesome Stay,"Reserved by IHG membership one night in this most beautiful hotel in the world, it’s quite memorable! Room is big and clean even thought it’s bit of out dated , awesome big indoor pool & staffs , we checked in as early as 8:30 am no need to run outside , just rest in pool area and a cup of hot tea , at 11 am the dancing exercise program in the pool so so fun , plus spa was helping eased some of back pains, Thank god ! As hotel recommended we took a short boat ride through the back of the hotel felt more happier , hotel concierges helped to buy museum ticket inside the hotel too , great service ! love love the tea & apple pie in lounge, lunch in basement has Vegetarian option , room service pretty professional too! Can’t wait to come back in the future !",50
Nice hotel,"Hotel was recently renovated and did not disappoint. Room view was waterfront and quiet. Hotel staff was helpful in regards to restaurant suggestions. Bartender was a bit surly, which caused us to walk across the street. Location to downtown could have been better, but we like to walk. Situated mid way between the museums we wanted to visit and the downtown area. We would stay here again.",40
A gem in Amsterdam,"The Amstel was a wonderful choice for our stay. The staff was gracious and helpful. The concierge was knowledgeable and spot on with every recommendation. Our room had a glorious view overlooking the river. Our room was beautifully decorated, large, bathed in light. The entire hotel is beautifully decorated. We loved sitting outside enjoying a drink or meal. The quieter location is a plus.",50
Third time's a charm,"This was my third time staying at this beautiful Grand Dame of a hotel. We were horse shopping in The Netherlands for about five days, and chose to stay once again at the Amstel. We had three rooms, and all were facing out to the canal with gorgeous views. This hotel is old, and it certain areas shows it age, chipped paint, creaky floors, etc... but on a whole what it lacks in those area, makes it for it in its beautiful location, wonderful service, and gorgeous views. My daughter had her 21st bday dinner in the restaurant down on the canal, and the pastry chef prepared a beautiful desert and gorgeous presentation. A few small complaints, we were in a non smoking room, which clearly had previous smoking guests. But we chose not to switch as my daughter and our friend were",50
Amsterdam,"Wonderful place. The staff is professional, warm and kind. The concierge (all of them) know their city. The suggestions of restaurants are right on. My daughter’s and I loved the canal ride and lunch. We will be back.",50
What happened to the 5-star continental breakfast...??!!!,"We sometimes lodge in Amstel hotel overnight just because we love the experience and the atmosphere. This time, everything about rooms and facility was fantastic as always but the breakfast was not a 5-star experience anymore! Amstel hotel used to have a wonderfully huge and continental buffet breakfast but it seems that the extremely heavy cost-cutting exercise has visited their breakfast room as well in a very extensive way! The breakfast is changed to a weird combination of small and minimalistic buffet breakfast and a companying 3-option menu! The buffet was pretty sad, small and lacks pretty much everything, and is similar to an average 2-star hotel. Even the selection of Dutch cheese and bread are now gone. It seems that the new owner (Katara hospitality) has a",40
"Overprice alert, lower your expectations","I like intercontinental hotels so pick this based on my previous good experiences, but i think you must think twice if you looking into stay there. Once again, in a great location near Amstel, you can easily walk the whole Amsterdam Centrum which is an area for anything you wish to visit from restaurant, bars and pastries to Cannabis stores and brand shoppings and of course the sightseeings. It’s a beautiful building in peaceful area, I stayed at river side room which i suggest as an essential(view-wise). But these beauties won’t last when you get inside. Poor hospitality, the reception is a desk with one staff! You must wait for one to be finished then you can proceed, it was ok if there was a lobby but there isn’t. Nowhere to chill and enjoy a cup of coffee. The whole floor",30
Great stay at this beautiful historic hotel,"Stayed 4 nights in late July 2019. Spacious classically designed room. Air conditioner worked great which was a big plus as we were there during the city’s record breaking heatwave(over 100 degrees). Friendly staff and service. Beautiful public areas,restaurants and bar. Terrific spa and pool making it hard to leave the hotel even for sightseeing. Highly recommend",50
Post-Cruise Stay,"After an awesome 8 days Rhine river cruise we were escorted around 10am to the Amstel. We were promptly greeted before entering the hotel and walked to the check in area where were greeted with champagne. A seamless and very professional check in process. Our room was ready, so we were escorted by the person who checked us in to show the room giving all the details. Our luggage promptly arrived. We were able to settle in, go to the atrium of this grand hotel review our maps and hit the ground running to see this awesome city without having to worry about when our room was going to be ready. The concierge was extremely helpful as was all the staff during our stay. The staff in solarium, bar staff, restaurant staff, bellman, doorman, management and housekeeping were all",50
Palatial luxury hotel.,"Located within the central canal ring of Amsterdam, just minutes walking from most of the city's attractions, the InterContinental Amstel is a very good base of operations for tourism. The palatial structure matches the rich indoors decor of the common areas, and the 1-star Michelin restaurant is the cherry on top. We arrived sometime before noon, and since our suite had been upgraded to one of the Penthouse Suites which had been occupied the night before (we were offered the suite we had booked immediately, or wait for the upgrade... guess what we chose?), we just took care of the check-in paperwork, handed over our suitcases, and set out to see the city. Shortly after noon, we received a call to let us know our Penthouse Suite was waiting for us (you did guess, didn't you?).",50
Overpriced,"We were at this hotel for four nights, location was good, housekeeping was very nice but room service, restaurant menu and hospitality doesn’t get good rates. Lobby services were poor. At arrival our luggage was not even taken. Internet speed was disappointing. And overall i think it was overpriced!",30
Fantastic weddinf weekend!,"My husband and I stayed there for our wedding weekend and had the most amazing stay. Although we did not host our wedding here, we had many of our guests stay at the Amstel. We are from Hong Kong and the protests unfortunately caused a number of guests to miss a day of their stay due to flight cancelations. Amstel was incredibly helpful and thoughtful during this time and called us to check on which guests were affected and offered to cancel the lost day. We were also upgraded to a spectacular suite and was also treated to champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. The hotel is as grand and majestic as we expected and the service was also attentive and friendly. The breakfast was also delicious and we loved starting each day with a glorious meal overlooking the Amstel river.",50
Grande dame,"The Amstel stays as the grande dame of the city. Unbeatable location, wonderful building. Great food at restaurants, excellent breakfast and the always beautiful pool and spa installations. We had an executive suite of generous size, big compartimentos bathroom, everything tasteful and in refurbished condition maintaining classic elegance. Staff is well trained and very nice. My only not ideal comment relates to the width of the bed. King beds are a standard in suites. Due to the diagonal position of the bed, the architects decided they had to go for a 180 cm wide bed which I consider not correct. The real king size bed mesures 200 cm",40
Breakfast blues.,"A very nice hotel on the banks of the Amstel River. Classy entrance foyer, accommodating, friendly staff in all departments, beautiful bedroom and bathroom with lovely view. Pillows to die for and an oh so comfortable mattress. Only let down were the breakfasts. Service was charming but slow. Used plates not cleared away in a timely manner, and eggs arrived lukewarm. I actually had to ask for a warm plate when I chose to eat from the Bain-Maries. Sorry to be negative but after the delights of the Adlon Kempinski this was a world apart.",40
Business and tourist central,This was our second group stay at the Amstel Hotel for business coupled with some private tourist activities. Private dining was again superior with the cocktail service along the Amstel River and dinner in a private dining room. The hotel has docking facilities for private boat tours. The rooms continue to be very high quality with great views of the river. The staff is well trained and responsive.,50
TERRIBLE HIGH TEA NOT RECPECTING ALLERGIES,FIRST OF ALL - mentioning on the phone specific allergies SECOND - arriving to the high tea and still telling about very serious allergies that can get me to the hospital (chicken) then --- after mentioning it 5 times they still give me chicken dishes telling them again I'm highly allergic for that. next dish is coming out they're explaining about all kinds of disgusting bread dishes where the bread is dry and the spread on the bread is even better in the supermaket. she mentions chicken so again we ask her is there chicken? she bluffs and says no no chicken. we start eating and it wasn't good to begin with then we see chicken. If only I would have eaten a piece I WOULD HAVE GOTTON TO THE HOSPITAL!!! SHAME ON YOU TERRIBLE SERCIVE AND TERRIBLE FOOD,10
Nice five star hotel,"This is a very good five star hotel. We had a room with view to the Amstel river. The ambience of the hotel is very nice, but you could expect even better service with this location and prices. Breakfast was not satisfactory",40
Grand but a tad tired,"We stayed at this hotel for free as we had a free IHG hotel stay anywhere in the world. We chose this as it has a great reputation and previous guests have included royalty and the likes of George Cloonie and David Bowie. Im sure this was the grandest hotel of its day but our visit was nothing special really. The room had echoes of grandure but the carpet was dirty, the TV quite dated. The room needs a facelift to be honest. We are now staying at the Crowne Plaza in the south of the city and both agree that it is a much finer hotel alltogether. If i had paid the going room rate at the Amstel I would have been feeling a little had.",40
Beautiful but too slowwwww,"I went for a business lunch at its restaurant. The hotel is fascinating. The restaurant is very well decorated. It also provide great view of the amstel river. However, the service is so slowww. It kept us forever to get one thing. And another forever to get another thing.",20
Love this Grand Hotel!,"The Amstel is a grand old dame - and she has been treated well. The hotel is in a lovely location on a canal (hard not to be on a canal in Amsterdam, however), but this canal was relatively quiet and away from the heavily-touristed part of Amsterdam. Our room was amazing - I loved that the windows opened - the weather was great! We had several breakfasts in the hotel as well. They were delicious. The terrace bar was wonderful as well. The Amstel staff was superb, friendly and professional, as you would expect at an InterContinental. Amstel is a lovely luxury experience in a great city. I would stay there again and again.",50
"Lousy service, not much to rave about","Appalling service. Rude staff. Yes the view is nice and the cakes/scones were great BUT the sandwiches are big standard (except served inside the bread (for decades already...c’mon - get creative!!!!), there were only 3 varieties of tea served (used to be more) and they cut down on their savory elements. Plus the staff forgot to give our table our chocolates and got our bill wrong. Rubbish. Much better alternative options in town. Amstel are passé on the high tea scene. ☹️",10
Service no good,"We were at a party in the “spiegelzaal” tonight. The people serving us were not so friendly and were not speaking clearly. We expected younger, more fitting and friendlier employees. We wanted to order gin tonic or grey goose to drink, but the employee did not know what this was. We were shocked and could not understand how an employee working in the ballroom did not know what this was. We thought we were in a high class hotel, known in Amsterdam with such a big name and the employees did not even know what a gin tonic is, how is this possible? The food was served without any effort, it was just thrown on the plates and tables. We then ordered wine because this was something they did have, and even this took atleast 15 minutes to arrive. We were very disappointed, our friends",10
First row. First class.,"For me by far the best hotel in Amsterdam. Perfectly located in the middle of the city. Book a room on the upper floors overlooking the water. the rooms are large and decorated with valuable antiques. Everything has style and elegance, that team is friendly and discreet. The best thing for me is to sit on the terrace by the water and drink a cocktail from the first-class bar. Sure, there are cheaper hotels in Amsterdam. But none that is worth its price so much.",50
The Brasserie: Truly Exceptional and Elegant Wine-paired Menu with Excellent Service for 10,"Our dinner party for 10 at the Amstel Brasserie was one of the greatest evenings of wining and dining I've ever experienced. (I'm 59, so that says something.) The food was delicious and the presentation impeccable; truly the stuff of the finest dining. The setting was classic and elegant. The service and wine pairing, just incredible. I erred in not asking the name of the servers and sommelier, so I could mention them here, but a big thanks to each for making the dinner party a truly (truly) memorable experience. A special thanks to InterContinental Groups & Events Manager Mui-Ling Wang. Very gracious, very professional, and just a very nice person. She did a great job in arranging the evening, which included celebrating the 75th birthday of one in our party. (The cake was",50
A taste of a bygone era,"We stayed for two nights and had a very memorable experience. The decor and ambience of the hotel remind you of a bygone era. Very traditional and elegant. The staff were excellent and we made use of the pool, the fitness centre and the spa all of them were excellent. We had dinner at the brasserie one night which was very good although they did have trouble accommodating the two vegans in our party. The location is great with lovely views from the rooms and terraces. We were able to walk to most of the attractions in Amsterdam.",50
We arrived merely as (IHG) Ambassadors but were treated as Royalty,"I have deliberated for almost a year in trying to adequately describe the wonder of our stay at the Amstel. Although the time has come to give this review I know that words cannot adequately describe or do justice to the overwhelming and absolutely delightful experience that we had there. TripAdvisor quite properly encourages reviews to give as much information as possible about a Hotel but the Amstel is so much than hotel accommodation. It is an experience to treasure. It is a discovery of such delight that a guide, rather than a detailed description, is all that I am going to provide. Therefore, I simply: - commend the management and staff for their outstanding service. Only once before have I ever experienced service of such quality and care. Thank you. - recommend in",50
Phenomenal experience...one of the finest hotels we have ever stayed in. We will definitely be back.,This is one of the finest hotels we have ever experienced....and we do quite a lot of traveling. The service is excellent. The hotel is splendidly posh and elegant.We will definitely return in future.,50
Overpriced and underwhelming,"Stayed one night (6/2/19) at end of river cruise. Room was 2 levels: bedroom and bathroom upstairs in basically the attic and sitting room and 1/2 bath on lower level. Upstairs air conditioning not working so it was like a sauna. Hotel solution was to provide a fan to blow the hot air around. Hot water faucet handle in 1/2 bath did not work but it was fixed while we were at dinner. Arrived on Sunday and when we tried to et lunch in hotel restaurant we were told it was fully booked. Glad for the hotel but first time I have ever encountered this. Staff less than warm and welcoming but from what other reviews I have read, typical Dutch. Room price was very high and very overvalued.",10
End of Tauck tour,"This hotel was part of out Tauck tour. Tauck paid for one night and we paid for the second. So far we have not been impressed. From a 30 minute delay to check in to a warm room, it does not rate as a top hotel. The check in could have been improved by adding another clerk. The young lady at the desk said they couldn’t afford more staff. I guess my question is where was the manager to help out? Of course she didn’t go over anything about the wifi or breakfast or how to operate the air conditioning in the room. That was left up to us to determine. Unfortunately it reached 90 degrees today. The room is facing the sun and become very warm. We asked to have it checked. The young man that came admitted it was warm and said he has another room with the same problem. However",30
Great place,"My wife and I spent one night here before boarding a Viking River Cruise boat. The hotel concierge arranged an airport transfer for us when we arrived in Amsterdam and also had made a reservation for us at the hotel's fine-dining restaurant. Our room was spacious and luxurious, the hotel itself was very quite, and the location was excellent. Our dinner was first-rate, and the staff did a great job of explaining several exotic dishes. Both the hotel rate and the dinner tab were on the high end but were well worth it.",50
This could be my favorite hotel!,"I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this may be my favorite hotel of all. The decor of this Old World hotel is beautiful and charming without being overly stuffy. The staff are exceptionally trained, helpful and professional. Breakfast is lovely and relaxing as is the terrace for lunch or cocktails. The location is perfect with taxis readily available outside and just a block or two from both a metro station and a tram stop. If I could give this hotel more than 5 stars, I would. We stayed 3 nights and I'm only sorry we didn't stay longer.",50
Outstanding!!,I'm really surprised this isn't higher on the TA list. This is an outstanding hotel with the kind of charm you don't see anymore. The staff is excellent and friendly without being to overly sweet. We booked through AmEx which I highly recommend as the room upgrade was especially appreciated. We were there for an anniversary and I don't think the hotel could have been nicer or done more to make us feel welcome. They really went out of their way. The breakfast is one of the nicest we've seen. If you're looking for something different I'd suggest reserving one of their vintage boats for a picnic along the canals. Ben is highly knowledgeable and an expert Captain. Very Impressed with everything and everyone.,50
"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Staff","Can’t rave enough about this hotel, its location and it’s staff. Check in was a breeze and the room and view was exceptional. Was able to walk to most locations. Breakfast buffet was an experience. Best of all was the staff especially the concierge. As usual didn’t plan well enough and required extensive help in arranging museum and dinner reservations. Concierge staff made up for our lack of planning and provided us with a special experience in Amsterdam. With the exception of the TV set that was too complicated this was one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at. Kudos to the staff.",50
Lovely hotel with understated elegance,"I spent six days at the Intercontinental and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I booked with American Express. The room was upgraded to a room with a view of the Amstel River which was spacious and bright with large windows that actually open! The breakfast buffet was excellent, with fresh fruit every day and a wide selection of delicious food as well as eggs dishes to order. The fruit smoothies were a treat. The lobby, tea room, and bar are very pleasant. The staff was very friendly and helpful, but not pushy. I loved the old elegance of the building and the quietly attentive service. I also liked that it is a little bit away from the very busy central square area but it still very well located to the museums and other attractions. I would definitely stay there again if I",50
Anniversary celebration- Wonderful hotel in a superb location,"We went for our wedding anniversary and the welcome we got could not have been warmer. The hotel is a stunning 19th century building, chic and refined situated on the Amstel river. The welcome was warm and friendly. Our room was beautiful, spacious and overlooking the river at the front of the hotel. It was luxuriously appointed, large with a very comfortable bed and a big bathroom with lovely toiletries, separate bath and shower, lots of fluffy towels and gallons of hot water. There is a superb lounge for a light snack, drink or afternoon tea, which overlooks the river. It is very light as the roof is glass as in a large conservatory. We arrived in time for coffee and a snack here before embarking on their lovely wooden canal boat for a private trip around the canals. It was",50
Okay but not fabulous,"Our stay was to celebrate our birthdays - we were expecting fabulous and didn't quite get it. Check-in was pleasant but slow. We arrived at about 13:00 and as our room wasn't ready we opted to have lunch in the Amstel Brasserie whilst we waited. We had a very leisurely and thoroughly enjoyable lunch - service, food and view all excellent - but no-one turned up as promised to let us know the room was ready. So we pootled back to reception and went through another 15 minutes of faff before we finally got the keys to our room. So eventually to the room - upgraded because of status to a standard room with canal view (wow) - and it was all a bit underwhelming; a bit poky and the furniture had seen better days; as had the carpet which didn't appear to have seen a vacuum for a",30
Elegant and friendly!,"This is my sixth visit to the Amstel and each time is better. First, it is beautiful! Perfectly situated at canal’s edge, it offers a lovely view from restaurants and outdoor areas, and it is conveniently located to several tram stops. From here one can travel anywhere in the city on public transport and there are easily obtained taxis and Uber cars, moderately priced. The Amstel Concierge staff is the best I have experienced in Europe since the old days of CLARIDGE’S in London. There is no task these well-trained people will not willingly undertake to insure that each visitor’s stay is perfect. Another stellar staff is that of Room Service - rapid response and very personable people. Though I am reluctant to criticize, I would point out that though my room was clean and",50
Elegance defined,"We were fortunate enough to have stayed for 3 nights at the Amstel. From the moment of arrival to the moment of departure we experienced the very best of this luxury hotel. The hotel offers a graceful elegance that is able to be experienced in the common areas, lounges, and La Rive. We have a few suggestions for any traveler. First, enjoy the access and availability of the Boats at the hotel. The captain gave a tour to a small group one afternoon but then we welcomed the suggestion of the concierge to hire the boat and captain for an evening cocktail cruise and delivery to our restaurant choice that night. We spent almost an hour and a half touring the city by boat and receiving the educational knowledge of the captain about the city. That was terrific. Second, enjoy an evening",50
Great meal on outside terrace,"Had excellent evening meal in the hotel’s brasserie in the warm April sunshine prior to a concert at nearby Theatre Carre. Great view, very good service and very tasty food, lovely place to spend a couple of hours!",40
Beautiful and elegant,"This hotel is beautiful and very elegant. Service is also very good and the rooms are large (including a big beautiful bathroom). The hotel has a ritzy feel to it as you would expect and is nicely set on the canal (great spot for a drink before dinner). We stayed in 3 hotels on our trip and this location is not our favorite, but convenient to the U. of Amsterdam where one of our children is on exchange. The rooms need more places to charge devices (or more adapters) and could use a night light in the bathroom.",50
Great centric location!!!,Went to a corporate event in Amsterdam held in its premises. They pay attention to details and the staff is always willing to assist with anything you may need. The hotel is just in front of the Central Station so its ideal to commute to other nearby cities and towns (such as Leiden and The Hague). I would recommended to anyone planning to travel to Amsterdam. Keep in mind it is a bit pricey!,50
The Very Best Hotel In Holland & Top 10 In Europe,"Since 1995, I have stayed at the InterContinental Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam. It is the finest hotel in Holland by far. Presidents, Prime Ministers, Celebrities and world class Music Artists stay at this luxury hotel. On one occasion when I was there, I visited with lead guitarist of the Eagles. A few days earlier, Paul McCartney and his band was present. When the filming of Ocean 12 was taking place, the entire cast stayed at InterContinential for a month! Over the years, I have entertained leaders here for dinner. The restaurant is the finest in Amsterdam and one of the best in Holland. I cannot say enough about this luxury property. If you are looking to get away and enter into a new world of service, then stay at this hotel. I have stayed in almost every level of hotel",50
Disappointing,"Very disappointing stay at this property. - Despite requesting a room away from the elevator when I booked, I was given a room literally right next to it. When queried with reception staff I was told that the hotel was full and no other rooms were available. A subsequent search of the IHG website, and further confirmed by the duty manager, revealed that this was in fact not the case - there were numerous other rooms available. - Despite the fact I was completely able to carry my own luggage (and communicated as such) it took 90 minutes and then multiple phone calls to have it delivered to my room. - Air conditioning in the room was not working, I had open the window to cool the room down to get some sleep. - Housekeeping staff helped themselves to coins left on the desk during",20
Wonderful Gluten Free Afternoon Tea experience,"I booked The Amstel Lounge's Royal Afternoon Tea to treat a client after a full day photoshoot. We requested that it was Gluten Free and without meat, since my client has gluten intolerances and is a vegetarian. I will be honest: we were a bit nervous, because it's hard to find a place where special diets are well catered for. We shouldn’t have worried. The Tea was 3 courses, all 100% gluten free, all nothing short of spectacular, and in the middle of each course, a different tea, served differently each time (they explained that, in order to fully appreciate each tea’s aromas, we needed a different container). First came a green tea in a cup. Then came mini salads and seeded gluten free bread with dips, vegetables and salmon (my client does eat fish) and chicken (for",50
Polite but not helpful,"The personel was very polite but double-charged my credit card despite explicit lack of my authorisation and call from agency organizing the trip. In case any problem they will make it your problem, not their. I don’t recommend staying in this hotel.",10
Quintessential grand hirek,"If you are visiting the wonderful city of Amsterdam, the chances are that a love of a setting by the water has figured in ur choice of destination. If so, and u are looking for a 5 star upscale property, the Amstel is an obvious choice. Location is superb - it is right by the river so its public rooms have wonderful water views even if ur budget doesn’t stretch to having a room with one. There are 3 tram and 2 metro routes close by that take u quickly and cheaply to key points in the city eg central station, museum square etc. Staff are excellent in all departments and nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are well equipped and generously proportioned. See my separate post for a detailed review of the fine dining restaurant La Rive. The gym is well equipped with a decent",50
Iconic 5 Star Hotel in perfect location,"Our stay at the Amstel Hotel fell nothing short of expectations. Professional front desk and restaurant staff, beautiful room and location was perfect to explore Amsterdam by foot. High Tea experience was lovely and Bar/Lounge program both progressive and traditional. Everything comes at a price including 70 Euros for overnight car parking but we did research beforehand so no hidden costs here. Only minor glitz was concierge Peter asking me if I was a hotel guest when asking for directions to the pool after we had a lengthy conversation the day prior after check-in procedures. I assume it had to do with my less than textbook Amstel Hotel attire that morning so all good in the end.",50
50th birthday in style!,"What can I say other than “thank you & wow “ Upgraded to a river view suite for my big 50 birthday! Just an amazing hotel, check in with fizz, great service and a fantastic breakfast team! Location was perfect for site seeing and dining All in all a winning hotel",50
The Best Of The Best In Amsterdam,"Sensational experience. Spa exceeded expectation. Finest hotel staff I’ve experienced in years. Concierge informative and helpful. Slight delay in room availability upon arrival, however, the staff at this beautiful property accommodated. Could have stayed there for weeks.",50
Classic,We had a suite and it was on one of the top floors. The beds were comfortable. the living room area furniture is classic but dated. All the expected luxuries were included. The concierge was very helpful. Nice location to walk around and see the town.,40
Sleep in a landmark,"This hotel is a touristic attraction. Even if you don´t stay here, you will take pictures of its lovely façade. The hearty breakfast buffet, the fancy diner, afternoon tea in the solarium, drinks at the bar, we enjoyed all their facilities and regret not to bring swimming suits for their beautiful pool. Since my husband is Aspire member, we were upgraded to a spacious room with river view, The garland at the door and the miniature Christmas tree gave a cozy feel to our December trip. The only but was the half flight of stairs in our room, which made it difficult to reach the bathroom at nights.",50
Beautiful classic hotel in Amsterdam,Three nights at the Amstel. What a magnificent hotel. Staying at hotels like the Amstel and previously the Le Grand in Paris one really feels that you are staying among history as I guess you rightly are! But with all the modern conveniences. Check in was very professional and included walking us to our room and showing the facilities. Nice touch. The room was of beautiful and quite spacious. All facilities we required were present. Location is quite central and we had no problems walking to nearby shops and tourist attractions. The concierge services were very helpful finding out our onward travel and arranging a visit to one of the diamond merchants in Amsterdam. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Amstel and would have loved to stay longer in the beautiful city of,50
Without doubts deserves to be called the best hotel in Europe,The spirit of Amsterdam with one look out of the window and perfect hospitality from A-Z. The receptionists not only kind but with personal engagement. The room very comfortable and with good taste arranged until the smallest detail. The breakfast fresh and inspiring. If you are curious and want to know more - the IHG application will lead you fast there...,50
"Didnt mind the old-ish property, as was more displeased with the staff","For background, am just a Gold Eilte IHG member. Stayed at the Amstel for three days for business recently, first time. On the property itself, its nice but there are also many other new and better-facillitied places to stay in Amsterdam for sure. However, what prompted me to write this review was the staff, notably the front desk staff. Curt and abrupt and generally really unhelpful to the extent that I thought to myself 'You people really seem not to want to be at this job and so, why don't you just quit, so that you make way for better staff?'. Doorman never there when you need a cab, ever. Only redeeming part of the service is the housekeeping manager. Not returning unless I can help it.",10
Magical birthday weekend,"If you are looking for a hotel with a soul, look no further. From the moment you enter this stunningly beautiful place, you are in a different world and you are treated like royalty. When we entered our room for the first time, I was overwhelmed by its' beauty. The luch at the hotel restaurant was divine and our lovely waiter gave us excellent service. My husband and I celebrated my birthday weekend at the Amstel Hotel and I cannot imagine it being more special than it was. You will for sure find other beautiful and luxurious hotels in Amsterdam - but none like this one. Staff goes above and beyond to make your stay unforgettable. They not only do their jobs well but they love what they do and you can feel it. On top of that, I cannot emphasise enough the beauty of the",50
Excellent Home when visiting Amsterdam,"We absolutely loved our six night stay at the Amstel Hotel, it far surpassed our expectations. To begin, the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. From check in, breakfast each morning - a true highlight, and all the suggestions from the concierge, we were well taken care of. The location is perfect, near enough to walk to everything, but out of the crazy busy area.",50
Nice classic style hotel,We stayed for a winter weekend in lovely Amsterdam and enjoyed the classic style and peace in this hotel. Our room didn't face the river so we felt a little cut off from classic Amsterdam views but the room was very well appointed with everything you could need. Staff were helpful throughout. We paid for breakfast which was nice but at 40 euros each much higher than equivalents in hotels and not as indulgent as the Breakfast club restaurant nearby for 15 euros each. Little off the beaten track but great walking. Taxi from Centraal station was 25 euros and taxi to airport was 60 in rush hour traffic,40
5 stars all around,"A beautiful and massive old building, newly renovated on the corner overlooking the Amstel River. It’s grand and classic and a true historic 5 star hotel. I used an IHG free night certificate to book a Queen Executive city view and was upgraded to a King Executive River view due to my IHG platinum status (it was fairly quiet, I wouldn’t expect this upgrade during busy season). The room was fabulous, high ceilings, tons of space and a huge bathroom with lovely bathtub and separate rainfall shower. Two sets of big windows open up with views over the river and its stunning, especially at sunset. Service is impeccable, as you’d expect at a 5* hotel with sit down checkin, a free glass of prosecco, turndown with sweets and the like. I was given 2pm late checkout based on platinum",50
Amsterdam Adventure,"We recently stayed at the Amstel to celebrate the New Year in Amsterdam. The staff, the property itself, and the location were all perfect for our long weekend. We took the Penthouse Suite, which has a commanding view of the city and was the perfect spot to watch the fireworks. We plan to return to Amsterdam in the warmer weather and surely stay here again. We highly recommend the in-room massage, even more so than the spa - the masseuse was great! Easily one of the best properties in Amsterdam.",50
What a great hotel!,"Fantastic location. Beautiful, classy hotel. The service was what really clinched it for me. We arrived super early, 7am, and I certainly didn't expect to get a room right then (thought we'd just store our luggage and explore), but we were able to check in right away, and got an upgrade to a river view room (Platinum elite thanks to Chase IHG credit card). The staff overall was super attentive and very nice! Thank you, and we will be back :)",50
"Elegant, Fancy Hotel","The cab driver almost drove us off the road when we told her we were heading to the Amstel hotel. She knew all about the history of the hotel, and there's 150 years of history. On the mezzanine, there's even a mini museum of its history. Check-in was very specialized and personal. Ironically, the night before, we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Schiphol, and the check-in was 30 seconds there, which I also like. Here, they take a bit longer to ensure your booking details are correct. I've stayed a several Intercontinentals, and this one has the nicest rooms. The room is gorgeous and cozy. It felt like something out of a fairytale. It was spacious and flowery in decoration. The bathroom was also huge, about 1/3 the size of the room. We happened to stay the weekend of",50
Elegant old hotel overlooking the Amstel River,"We booked this grand old hotel on the banks of the Amstel River in Amsterdam at the end of a river cruise. We arrived early, having just embarked from our vessel, and our room was not ready yet. We looked around the public area of the hotel with its magnificent lobby complete with grand staircase to the second floor, lofty ceilings, crystal chandeliers, and lovely huge flower arrangements. The main fine dining room (La Rive) was located off the lobby in a beautiful atrium room adjacent to the terrace overlooking the river. This was also the location for the wonderful breakfast. Down one floor was a more casual dining venue (Brasserie) with a terrace that provided seating along and at the same level as the river. Reception was very formal, but not unfriendly. Same with the",50
Amazing Stay,"From the moment you arrive at the hotel, you receive an absolutely outstanding service. The staff go above and beyond for you and nothing is too much. The room was massive, and the spa facilities were great, with a great view of the river. The hotel is located right next to the metro, making travelling an ease. I will most certainly be staying here again, and I would like to thank all the hotel staff for making my stay so enjoyable.",50
The best high-tea in Amsterdam,I went to the Amstel hotel for the afternoon high-tea to celebrate my birthday. Be sure to arrive on time if not early and expect to be brought to your table group by group. the food was delicious and the tea paring was spot on. A real recommendation should you want something special but different than a dinner to celebrate something nice. The view of the Amstel river from the high-tea room is also breath-taking and peaceful.,50
A lovely classic hotel in Amsterdam,"The Amstel hotel is the grand dame in Amsterdam and it is a lovely hotel to stay in. The rooms are spacious, clean and very classic. The staff is professional and very helpful. The location off course is ideal, central but a bit away from the rumble. The only small comments I have are the shower. Very complicated to handle and slow to react on temperature changes. You always waste a lot of water until you find the right temperature. The other thing is minor but from the top hotel in Amsterdam you expect better. They still have an old sound bar with a iphone 4 docing station..... really???? in 2018????? Please take it away and install a bluetooth device",40
"Good size rooms, friendly staff, great location.","We arrived to a nice greeting and a glass of Proseco. We were early and our room not quite ready, we killed the time by having a late lunch in the restaurant on the water. The staff made us feel at home and let us know when our room was ready. The room had a great view, with windows that could be opened to take it all in! The museums are a 15 minute walk. The shopping district starts 5 minutes away. The hotel is mere minutes from multiple locals, we had a great breakfast around the corner with the locals in a bakery (not the only option). Parking is available at the hotel for $65 (Euro) per day and self parking is also out front for $36 (Euro) for 24 hours (very limited during the week). Self parking has to be paid daily with a CC at the meter. Concierge is very",50
